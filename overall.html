        <p><b>Overall Negative Sentiment Proportion</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Possible reasons:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Online content tends to attract more positive comments.</li>
                <li>People tend to be mindful of the emotional tone of their comments.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>However, negative comments are often more noticeable, so the impression of a subreddit may be worse than reality.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>"Growth" Category's Extreme Sentiment Distribution</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Possible reasons:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Recent growth topics are more eye-catching, sensational, and have more discussion potential.</li>
                <li>There may be trolling behavior, leading to more emotional comments overall.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Recent growth topics make it difficult for users to maintain a neutral stance, possibly related to media traffic.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>"Interesting" Category's Lowest Negative Proportion</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Possible reasons:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>The content of the subreddit is more lighthearted or meaningless.</li>
                <li>Most of the content is not very nutritious, so users may experience less emotional ups and downs.</li>
                <li>Users can identify that the subreddit is simply for fun, so they usually respond in a relaxed manner.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Many interesting subreddits have very nonsensical titles, some of which are quite offensive, but the comments are often filled with a lighthearted atmosphere.</li>

            </ul>
        </ul>

            <li>Most users express anger towards the content shared in the subreddit.</li>
            <li>Some users use sarcasm to mock the content, but the model marks these as positive, so the actual average score should be even lower.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>r/politics</b></p>

            <li>This subreddit has rules requiring users to be polite and prohibiting offensive comments.</li>

        <p><b>r/Giraffesdontexist</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Most content is so serious that it makes people wonder if itâ€™s satirical.</li>
            <li>The term "conspiracy" appears very frequently.</li>
            <li>Users in this subreddit are deeply immersed in the belief that "giraffes don't exist, and the giraffes in zoos are a conspiracy by the government to make us believe they exist."</li>
