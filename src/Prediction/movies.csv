"It's horror-scifi, just like Alien, Predator, Event Horizon, and The Thing.

However, we have to have separate genres to put stories into and horror is its own genre",1
"Terminator's core premise is scifi, with horror being the tone",0
So it goes in the 'scifi' bucket.,0
That was my biggest gripe with the story,0
There's a making-of documentary that showed exactly what went on behind the scenes and it's mindblowing that a gigantic production like this didn't have their core story / emotional arc figured out when it was months away from release,1
They just winged it for a long time until they had to do \_something\_ because delaying wasn't an option.,2

Here is a list off the top of my head of notable characters and shows, some having aged better than others.


- Little Lulu/Audrey
- Baby Huey
- The Stupidsticious Cat
- Popeye (Mainly the later theatrical releases, with the more fluid character animations).
- Grampy (they released the famous Christmas short in HD recently and it looks amazing!).
- Superman (not my favourite, but amazing none the less).
- The Enchanted Square (Highly recommended, bring tissues!).


Here are a few sample YouTube channels to check out if anyone has an interest in Golden Age animations and film preservation, Seth McFarland himself is in the middle of releasing old content again from the Fleischers too!

I love me a good pun,1
I love even a bad pun,2
And that was a bad pun,2
In the best way,1
I look forward to the rest of the series,0
"For some reason when I think satoshi kon i just think about the ""rape"" scene in perfect blue where the guy is like ""i'm sorry"" and she's like ""it's ok."" that's just the first thing that comes to my mind",1
"it's like it's creepy but also not creepy, but then also creepy",2
i don't know,0
that's the scene that sticks in my mind,0
anywhoo,0
i'm a bit drunk i suppose,2
night night,0
"love me some animation.

animation is a medium, not a genre",1
rip satoshi kon,0
The Devils Advocate,0
Because of the Thrawn Trilogy,0
"Star Wars was dead until those books resurrected it, started the extended universe, and proved there was still money to be had",2
They were and still are better than any of the movies that followed them years later.,1
What made Disney movies so good is they were never targeted to specific ages,1
"Of course they were always ""family"" movies",0
They were targeted for all audiences not just kids,0
"There was crude humor that any adult would get, and more tame humor for the kids",1
Kids wouldn't understand the complexities of crude humor,2
"You can easily confirm this yourself when you go back and watch their older movies from pre-2013 (anything post-2013 IMO started to fall off drastically)

The issue is that kids nowadays are smarter, they understand the crude humor",1
They can't just use the same formula to make their movies accessible anymore,1
So instead they exclusively target people of ages that can't comprehend the humor,1
Making everything they make appear dull.,2
Abyss should be fine,1
Eddard Stark in Game of Thrones..,2
üòá,0
This one is a maybe; but Kristen Stewart in The Clouds of Sils Maria,0
In that she literally vanishes while hiking mid-scene and didn't appear (or I don't think is even mentioned) for the rest of the film,0
I was like; what the hell just happened? She might have died or injured herself or just run off,0
But it really came out of nowhere.,1
"If I want a giant screen and sound with a leather recliner in a dark and quiet auditorium where I can focus completely on the film, I go to the theater",1
"If I want to sit on the couch and watch a movie on a TV that‚Äôs a fraction of the size of a theater screen in my cluttered living room that‚Äôs never quite dark enough with people wandering in and out and the phone ringing and kids interrupting the film and pausing it for various reasons and the dog barking, I‚Äôll stay at home and be surrounded by distractions.",1
"Fair point, but the movie largely focuses on the female murderer, so yeah, is about lust largely",1
"Yo chill, my dad took my to see this when I was like 9, snuck into the theatre, movies strait fire and I won‚Äôt hear any alternate opinions.",0
nor ever rewatch it,0
"No Way Out was like that, with Sean Young‚Äôs character",0
"Well-said!     
Johnson should have made an original sci-fi movie if he was so set on the genre instead of twisting the franchise into that abomination.",1
I wonder who the baddie would be,0
I ain't too proud to beg!,1
With how up they are it's not even realistic that they could see the ground through those binoculars,1
Fat Man,0
This movie could have been absolutely incredible with a more cohesive story and better writing,1
As it stands it's a swing-and-a-miss.,0
"Loving Vincent is a new favorite of mine.
Some else mentioned triplets of Seville but it‚Äôs worth mentioning again",1
Belle is a newer one that has good animation and a great soundtrack.,1
"I don't have a fancy set up, but I have seen ***Open Range*** used for the gun fight which sounds fantastic with surround sound.",1
"I watched it in 2020, the setting of the movie is definitely older, but I think it came out in the past couple of decades",2
Nimona,0
Animal Olympics! Yes!,0
I remember watching the DVD extras and they interviewed the author,0
I got the impression that the book was very different in both content and tone.,0
the prince of egypt,0
People who don't want to get killed by someone else doing the same thing,2
There is a 100% chance I would be out of the country for the purge,0
No reason to risk my family,0
Which is another reason the first movie is dumb,2
Rich people would absolutely just leave the US,1
"I'm not particularly rich, but have enough money that I could make sure we were out of the US",1
We have a modest boat,1
"Feel like worst case, we could drive to the coast and head for Mexico's waters",2
"If wasn't possible to get to another country, we would just move to another country.",0
Pleasantville (1998) is just before your cutoff date but wasn't a huge movie,1
I Saw the TV Glow,0
"Saw that scene when I was kid, up to this day still couldn't wrap how the fuck can that happen",2
Truly a wtf moment for me lol,1
"I was checking out his Instagram after I heard about it and someone posted 2 days before his death ""you don't need to exercise anymore"" that's some crazy foreshadowing even though I know it wasn't meant to be",2
RIP Man,0
Says someone with the most confrontational name possible.,1
Nic Cage is a brilliant actor! He faced financial problems when the real estate market took a dump,1
Many of us did,1
"He wanted to be honorable and not declare bankruptcy, so he took work that was offered",1
I admire him for that,0
"Even when he knew some material was subpar and he was grossly  underpaid on some of it, he worked his way through it",0
He put his whole self into each role even if it wasn't ocscar worthy material,1
He respects the craft and seems to have a good grasp on morality,1
I believe he gave each role his best,1
Life and the IRS can get in the way sometimes,0
Several of his current films are showing he's back!,0
That's fucking cool man,1
"What a great story to have, and thankfully there was no near-brush with a real great white ! :)",1
I always cue up the lobby shootout to test surround sound.,1
Daniels also has some crackers,0
"I love the speech he gives to Carver at the end of S1 when he finds out >!he was the rat!<.

""Couple weeks from now, you're gonna be in some district somewhere with 11 or 12 uniforms looking to you for everything",1
And some of them are gonna be good police,1
Some of them are gonna be young and stupid,2
A few are gonna be pieces of shit,2
But all of them will take their cue from you,0
"You show loyalty, they learn loyalty",0
"You show them it's about the work, it'll be about the work",0
"You show them some other kinda game, then that's the game they'll play",2
"I came on in the Eastern, and there was a piece-of-shit lieutenant hoping to be a captain, piece-of-shit sergeants hoping to be lieutenants",2
Pretty soon we had piece-of-shit patrolmen trying to figure the job for themselves,1
And some of what happens then is hard as hell to live down,2
Comes a day you're gonna have to decide whether it's about you ..,0
"or about the work.""",0
"Weirdly enough, Michael Madsen's character in Thelma and Louise",2
He's definitely playing against type.,0
I remember this movie more from its ad on free Willy more than actually watching it.,1
It sounds like a question in high school philosophy filmed for 2 hours.,1
It was colour samples for repainting the boat house at Hereford.,0
Frank Gallagher surviving the apocalypse and aiding monkeys seems very on brand for him,1
You should check out loving Vincent!,1
"I don't remember Captain Stemkowski yelling, but ""No mercy"" definitely had some of that Dirty Harry vibe.",2
You are correct according to Google,0
Someone getting their ass kicked has never looked so good.,1
I only heard of it because of r/cultofcinemaknowledge.,0
Hollywood needs to stop casting geriatric men in action movies.,1
Anastasia,0
An absolutely magical story based on the lost princess of Russia and a way better princess than any Disney character,1
Iron Giant and the prince of Egypt,0
"Having watched Hellraiser for the first time recently, that explains a lot!",1
A classic,1
Yup,0
Own it on blue ray.,1
I have their season pass,0
I absolutely love Alamo,1
They feel run by people who actually love movies,1
The Breadwinner,0
Where did you watch it?,0
I watched this alone in a movie theater and it bummed me out for so many reasons (not just the obvious),1
"When I was a kid, I used to read Garfield comics religiously (along with Peanuts and Calvin & Hobbes), but besides the '80s cartoon and specials, none of the recent efforts to revive the character have ever seemed to get it right",1
I feel like they sanded down the edges here and made him as innocuous and dull as possible,2
"All the cutesy eye kitten stuff was okay, but besides that brief montage of him growing up, we don't really get to see too much of the true Garfield personality",1
"It also really bothered me that Jon Arbuckle was so estranged from the events of this film, since he's always been a big part of why the comics worked for me (the quintessential loser who is always trying to get Liz)",1
"I mean, I know it's a family movie designed to appeal to kids of all ages, so I'm not the target audience or anything",2
"But it just makes me feel so fucking old and obsolete when I think back to all those countless hours I spent invested in those comics and adventures, only for them to reinvent the mythos and throw out the ""canon.""

Another pet peeve is that a lot of it takes place on ""Lactose Farms"" (what a terrible, generic name), but they could have easily made it U.S",2
Acres and involved Orson & Friends if they really wanted to go in that direction,1
"But instead, we have this weird father-son dynamic that never existed in the comics and now seems to be a permanent staple of this new reboot.

Also, I don't know what voice Chris Pratt was trying to do here, but this wasn't it",2
And the fact that Samuel L,0
Jackson plays his pop is really weird,2
"Even Odie's characterization seemed to be off, but whatever",0
I don't know why I'm investing so much of myself into dumb shit,2
It's just a bummer all around.,0
The Warriors had some cool looking mofos for sure.,1
"I don't usually like dumb movies, but this one is surprisingly funny",1
"I did not have high hopes, but right after I watched it, I recommended it to my Mom.",1
They're closed minded and clearly have rough taste in movies,2
"I get the frustration, but let it go and watch on your own",1
"Nothing good will come out of forcing them to watch it or feeling resentful.

As for Carpenter's The Thing? It's a timeless classic with incredible effects, it's truly a must watch for horror fans and movie buffs.",1
Its the dock fees that kill you,0
got a decade in mind?,0
Rob Schneider marathon,0
"I miss the roller coaster!

The popcorn burst was my way of knowing if the sound system was good.¬†

If it had a deep resonant POP, you knew the speaker system was good

If it was flat, or mixed with the rest of the sound, I knew I‚Äôd have to try harder to be invested.",1
End of Eva,0
Inception,0
Do you..,0
"genuinely not think women are a minority? That men don't run the planet? Do you think 99% of world leaders have been men because men are naturally better leaders? Gimme a break lol

Btw, not sure why you thought I'd be against women in the draft, lol",1
"What are you, 40? I'm against the draft in general because I hate war but I don't see a reason it should be exclusively men

And honestly..",2
"no, I genuinely don't think there's anything men are required for in society aside from protecting us from other men",1
"Like genuinely, in an all-woman planet where we're reproducing on our own (which honestly we're not that far off from scientifically), what would we be unable to do?

What does it matter if male soldiers are stronger if there's no male enemy to fight, what does it matter if there are no male cops if there are no male criminals?

Men can't solve a single problem they didn't already cause (maybe boxing would be a little more boring?)

I don't know who ingrained into your head that women are ""ungrateful"" for what men give us, or that other women make you look bad (if you think other women being bad is a valid reason to look down on you, you've got some issues to work through)",2
George Clooney in From Dusk Till Dawn is a contender.,0
"Anastasia

The Box Trolls",0
Not as horrendous as the thumbnail on this video.,0
A star is born,0
No not this one,0
I'm so annoyed I can't think of more details,2
I vaguely remember there being a ballroom scene with balloons (?),2
Great flick,1
Thx for reminding me to rewatch!,0
The 4K is one of the worst out there,2
So much DNR that everyone looks waxy,1
Truly a benchmark in how not to do a 4K transfer.,0
"Haven‚Äòt seen someone mentioning Nimona yet which i find a little bit sad tbh, it‚Äòs such a good movie",1
I think people are deterred by the Netflix Original logo,1
"I‚Äôll be honest, it‚Äôs a pretty good reveal, so I‚Äôd recommended watching it, and I probably won‚Äôt do a great job of explaining it.",1
"Have you watched Samurai Champloo? If not, I feel like you'd dig it a lot",0
"Judging from your list, we have somewhat similar tastes",0
"It's made by the same people as Cowboy Bebop, and while it's less known, I like it much much more.

And only like 20 episodes, so more accessible than a lot of longer running anime series.",1
World‚Äôs most intelligent techbro.,1
Same concept at least,2
Rise of the Guardians,0
‚ÄúI‚Äôm so humble,2
I instantly connected with that because I‚Äôm the most humble person I know.‚Äù - Mariah Carey,1
Avatar & Avatar 2,0
"As an old student of animation, Arcane is a work of art, it's so beautifully done, my heart almost aches watching it.

But so many more:

Akira

Ghost in the Shell

Robotech

Astroboy 

Cowboy Bebop 

Your Name

Castlevania",1
But that's not what the movie is saying,0
"In the tv show, they are already getting buried alive by Mr Melancholy",2
"Maddy then digs herself out of the grave and is reborn, and goes back to try to help Owen do the same",0
But he suppresses his true self and instead suffocates and is slowly buried alive,1
So it's really the opposite.,1
You're allowed to call us crackers but I'm not allowed to call you n,0
The point and over the garden wall,0
It's not..,0
"you know because the ring was the central plot point of the movie.Hence, the /s.",0
Game Night,2
Exactly,1
The opening credits of Army of the Dead is a blast of a zombie short,2
I wish he would do lots of music videos and even commercials.,1
"I wouldn't say he is not given credit, he just never 100% focused on being a comedy actor.",0
I think it can be also be seen in a slightly more positive light,1
They're starting their new relationship already knowing what they could eventually hate about each other,2
"A lot of relationships start out wonderfully because you're blinded by the newness and excitement of the bond you're forming, so when the real and flawed person slowly gets revealed, you can start to resent them for not being the idealic person they never actually were.¬†


I think it'd actually be wonderful to start a relationship knowing that some things about the other person are going to drive you insane",1
"And to know what they are too.¬†


Of course, I think the ending could be interrupted way more pessimisticly too",1
But I like viewing it as a (mostly) happy ending.,1
"Dying young?

Julia Roberta Campbell scott?",1
"Lots of people here are talking about how great the sequels are, but you hit the nail on the head, they're like Saw sequels that you watch for a blood-splattery bit of action under an interesting but now slightly worn premise",1
"I mean, I *like* the films and find them incredibly watchable, but I wouldn't call them *quality cinema*",2
"Especially when the later films have just been so unashamedly on-the-nose about the political ""subtext"", they could use a little more ""show, don't tell"".",1

It's animated but The Emperor's New Groove is an absolute riot.,1
Oh he's DEFINITELY the killer.,0
Prometheus,0
"Could have done some absolutely incredible galaxy expanding and bring new depth to the story, instead focussed on destroying the original lore while poorly attempting the exact same tropes done 4 decades ago, but with 100d dumber characters.",1
"huge wasted potential, especially given how culturally significant the first film is.

Runner up AvP",1
Plus you simply cannot break someone‚Äôs neck backwards without superhuman strength,0
That‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous.,2
Some good taste right here!,1
The real hero here,1
"Ohhh, so true",1
Kinda broke my heart a bit since spectre and that final craig movie were so meh,0
Since the first three were just *so* good.,1
One of Orson's best films.,1
"If you are talking about the Step Printing (and perhaps even with the under-cranking on top) effect? With the blurry background (and slowmo foreground)?    
  

Tarantino used it in the intro shot to Reservoir Dogs",1
IIRC there a few shots in Saving Private Ryan here and there using Step Printing,2
A lot of Asian films employed the technique,1
I remember Millenium Mambo had a ton of it,0
And John Woo used it a few times.,2
Bro how did you steal my answer? I wish it was socially acceptable to walk around wearing those goggles.,1
The blue ray version had too much blue light,1
It's like watching through a blue filter,0
The 4k was significantly better than the Blu-ray,1
"However, some background became easily identifiable as backings",1
Pixelation and blur hid a good bit of this.,1
People have this weird notion that James Cameron gives a shit about anything that isn't Avatar,2
Dudes literally said he's not going to do anything that isn't Avatar related until he fucking dies,2
The dude is off the rails,0
He gives zero fucks if they put clown noses in Terminator.,0

Anastasia,0
Adding to the list!,0
"As much as I like the two of them, I don‚Äôt know how I haven‚Äôt seen this one",1
I almost watched it over the weekend.,0
Little Nemo,2
It was one of the worst portrayal of Churchill I have ever seen.,2
The size will depend on the codec used for compression,0
"I always found .mkv files gave the best quality to size ratio, especially for animations",1
VLC is the best player.,1
Another banger brought to us by the great Joss,1
>You think his movies don't make sense,0
"Wouldn't that make you the stupid one?

Guy kills woman, woman shows up to his party with a detective, doesnt kick detective out",2
"Keeps napkin that is evidence in plain sight but its okay its because HES ACTUALLY a moron because he doesnt use the words correctly and woman had an identical twin, twist",2
"What a modern day agatha christie.

Still you dawg.",1
Ikr? Star wars is like the most overrated thing on the planet,1
It explained so much when I heard that the bigwigs behind it originally just tossed something together in order to sell toys to kids,2
I don't know how in hell it has even gotten so big since it's just some hastily put together toy advert stuff.,2
Its both sadly,2
Aliens come from a 2k scan that was upscaled and DNRed.,0
Yeah I don't get why more movies aren't set in Australia,1
Especially movies that take places in the distant future,0
Australia has such distinct  wildlife and wilderness its hard to pass of as another country,2
I see you got some Gaspar Noe movies in that list,0
I've watched all of his movies and all I can say is that he sure is a particular director,1
It feels like all of his movies want the viewer to stop watching,0
Jack Black is such a great comedic actor and not given the credit he‚Äôs due as a musician because he is a comedian.,1
Fantastic Planet,1
A fellow Doomsday enjoyer! Love that movie so much,1
The ending music video to Frankie Goes to Hollywood/Bently ad was fucking hysterical.,2
"That very basic ""call to adventure"" shouldn't be mistaken for the plot.¬†

"I had a situationship with a new Zealander when I was 19, and when I visited he was like ""Let's watch this little film about the maori culture""",1
"We watched ""Once Were Warriors""",0
It is burned into my brain,0
All of it,0
Not in the best way,1
Also Last House on The Left,0
I refuse to watch SA in films now,0
If it's in a film or TV show I turn it off,0
"Thank God I can't relate but I feel too much empathy and as a woman I just can't watch it.

In lighter news, Bridesmaids made me embarrass myself for doing actual spit takes and laughing too much on a plane",1
I don't know why but I found that movie SO fucking funny,1
Also Into the Wild and Across the Universe were staples of highschool for me,1
For existential and shit.,2
Controversial opinion: she didn't quite work for me in The Menu,1
"But that was mostly due to some poor writing and directing choices.¬†


Still liked the movie a lot, just less then the majority of this sub does.",1
Lmfao oh no the patriarchy,0
I was wondering when you were going to drop that,0
And i never said women were pathetic or dependent on men,2
That conclusion is all you hon,0
As i dont believe that for a second,0
"Do we need men to have a functioning society, Absolutely",1
Men do alot,0
You and all the women who think like you should be ashamed at how easily yall disregard all that men do for us,1
Let me say this now,0
This isnt some competition to me,0
We need each other to have a functioning society,2
"We complement each other.¬†


Well your point is ridiculous as giving birth and then taking multiple bullets or getting hit by multiple cars and still fighting is not the same thing",2
One is natural,1
One is not,0
"Also how well are women fighting after they give birth?! And how well would you fight after a broken rib, or a gun shot or two?! I am not only traditional",2
"I am a realist, not a crazy feminist",2
You sound like someone who has never been punched by a man,1
Also I am a twin,0
He is a male,0
I can see our differences and our strengths and we have the same parents and genes,0
Just because you want to live in some made up world where women are somehow superior and can do everything a man can doesn't mean you are living in reality,1
You are living in some make believe world you and other feminists prefer,2
But I like living in the real world where over 85% of our military and cops are male for a reason and this is with quotas and pushing for women to be represented,1
Women are not designed for intense combat,1
Can they do it,0
"Yes, but as well as a highly trained man",1
Absolutely not,2
They may be proficient in some areas but they will always lose in some aspect or another to a male counterpart,0
The packs they have to carry around alone in the military¬†most women can't do for miles,1
Women have lost the ability to have children after the basic military training alone and thats not even combat,1
They have been known to lose weight and have severe medical issues while their male counterparts gained muscle mass,2
This isnt an attack on women,0
Stop taking it as that,0
It's biological,0
Men are built differently,0
Being offended is just ridiculous,2
Women are amazing but stop acting like they can do everything as well as men,1
Why men dont take us seriously,2
We literally can't,0
Or are you okay with women being drafted along side the men if a war breaks out?! You willing to sacrifice all women to prove your point that we are equal in this realm? This really shouldn't be controversial,1
It's our reality,0
If you honestly think a 120 pound female can take down 180 pound man you are just not thinking thru,1
Maybe train with men in sparring or boxing classes and come back and talk to me,0
Men and women are not equal,0
But by all means go ahead and fight some men and see how you end up,0
I'm sure you can break a couple of ribs or take a few gun shots and keep on swinging and win,1
You seem like a fighter.,0
Blu-ray and DVD is different though.,0

I'm going to add a few more though:

Rene Laloux films - La Planete Sauvage/Fantastic Planet, Les Maitres du Temps, Gandahar

Alice by Jan Svankmajer

Felidae

Anime anthologies - Neo Tokyo, Genius Party (avoid Limitcycle, I was told to avoid it, I didn't, now I'm telling you, avoid it!), Genius Party Beyond, Robot Carnival

Patlabor - The first two movies are fantastic but it's recommended to watch the OVAs first",1
Whole franchise is good though.,1
"Would‚Äôve been great to get a prequel, so to speak, enlarging on that endless night we saw in the flashbacks",1
"Low-budget, visceral, fast.",1
Missed his other movie: Oblivion,2
The sky house sound is top notch,1

I snuck around and watched it anyway.",0
Neo from The Matrix,0
Paranorman is Laika's true masterpiece.,1

Remember when all movies were somehow 3D for some reason? It was the in-thing so studio executives jumped on it even if it made no sense,0
Same thing here,0
"AI is the in-thing, so studios are using it",0
"And like 3D,  badly.",2
barb and star go to vista del mar,0
It‚Äôs been suggested a few times,2
I‚Äôll look into it this week and see how I can watch.,0
"I just got out of a screening, I tend to not do that well with super overtly realistic gore but I was able to mostly make it through without shying away",1
If it's anything the kills don't last super long (there's also no torture) and the truly gory moments you can see coming,1
"That being said, I really liked the movie",1
It is super slow at times but if you can meet it at it's level it can really build up the tension.,1
"The Iron Giant, Batman, Mask of the Phantasm, Teen Titans, Young Justice, Akira, Castlevania, Blood of Zeus, Avatar The Last Airbender, Samurai Jack",1
"I‚Äôve seen the first two, heard of the third",1
I‚Äôll look into it.,0
"Hubris, sheer hubris if you ask me.

"Keating is so full of resentment towards the school for having responsibility thrust upon him without his say so, he makes out that he loves teaching as a signal of virtue when underneath it all he is doing everything he can to subvert the pupils thereby destroying the institution from the inside.

If all his pupils flunked, I‚Äôm quite sure he would just shrug and pass it off with some smug smile, saying how ‚Äúsuccess isn‚Äôt measured in certificates‚Äù‚Ä¶",1
"I find him as charming as the devil himself, who couldn‚Äôt like him? But ultimately he is the snake in the grass, offering innocent boys the temptations of worldly pleasure and sowing the seed of resentment.

Is it not shown clearly as satanism, to sneak off at midnight under the moon to a dark cave, huddle round a fire and play with passions till demons are summoned? 

It is inevitable of course, everyone must go through this process, but for Mr",1
"Keating to have such hasty and lofty Pride over what is essentially just common Sin‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs only one character in this life that is like that, and he has horns and a tail üòÇ

When Neil turned to Mr",2
"Keating, the Right thing was to tell him to obey his Father",1
"Instead he affirmed Neil‚Äôs emotions, he had no right to do this",1
"A teacher is there to teach, not to get embroiled in the emotional states of children and their relationships to their parents.

Sigh, if I had watched this film as a young man, of course I would see Mr",1
Keating as some victim of authority but alas I am just too long in the tooth for that now,2
"I may add, that I do make a concession for Todd",0
I do think that Mr,0
Keating‚Äôs approach is somewhat justified when dealing with a boy like Todd,1
He has issues and no relationship with his father at all,0
"He is lost completely.

That scar on the wrong side? Have VFX fix it ..,2
but if you notice it's not quite real in one shot you'll blame it on bad CG,2
That set that is obviously CGI extensions? Have VFX fix it ..,0
"but the extensions may never feel right with the practical lighting that was shot for the tight space, so you'll blame it on bad CGI.

There was a time when we couldn't fix as much stuff",2
And I think that did honestly make us make better movies,1
"But good film makers, great directors and art directors and make up people and VFX people, still strive to plan and organise and do their best",1
"They don't want to ""fix things"" but instead to make the right thing to begin with.

But it is pretty hard",1

I recently loved Everything, Everywhere, All At Once",1

- so the american film company sued to either get the money, or have them kicked off the project

Why are you being so aggressive about something as subjective as movie interests? It's not like I said either of those were bad.,2
Basically her naivet√© is attractive to a certain kind of man who romanticize innocence in women as the greatest virtue,1
"She‚Äôs the polar opposite of Kathryn, , kind, sweet, innocent, not a single manipulative bone in her body and sexually inexperienced",1
"S√©bastien has to trick her and get her drunk to get her to sleep with him initially and then Kathryn basically tells her to throw her box at every man who shows interest, so she can ruin her innocence",2
She‚Äôs Kathryn's true foil in the film,1
Attractive and doesn't know or use her sexualty to get what she wants,1
And yet still gets her guy in the end because they love each other,1
Meanwhile Kathryn is denied her final revenge because Cecile was too dumb to recognize that she was being manipulated until S√©bastien dies and by then Annette already read the journal and told her what was really going on,2
TLDR her idiocy is exaggerated to contrast the over the top villainy of Kathryn,1
And because the plot requires it,0
It's the weakest part of the story imo as someone who loves this movie.,1
Prometheus 4K Blu-ray is absolutely spectacular.,1
Really liked how Disney didn't and still doesn't overtly give the female animals' designs to resemble women like plenty of other animated movies from other studios,1

"I think they made lots of changes, including to Joel and Clementine! But it's always funny to see what stays and what goes üòä",1
"First, they would assemble a crew, including actors, a writer (or writers), camera operators, craft services and a director",1
"In preproduction they would come up with a list of shots they would need to shoot and a timeline to shoot it in.

At this point they will choose if they want Behemoth to be practical effects or CGI or a combination of the two",1
"They will do this with other shots too.

Once that is done, they can go into production where they would point the camera at the actors and have them act out the script",2
"Once they filmed everything (or wrapped, in industry speak), they will go into post production where they will edit the footage together and add all the needed digital effects",0
At this point they might show it to the studio and producers,0
Reshoots may be needed and usually are,2
