It is,0
"It's horror-scifi, just like Alien, Predator, Event Horizon, and The Thing.

However, we have to have separate genres to put stories into and horror is its own genre",1
"Terminator's core premise is scifi, with horror being the tone",0
So it goes in the 'scifi' bucket.,0
That was my biggest gripe with the story,0
There's a making-of documentary that showed exactly what went on behind the scenes and it's mindblowing that a gigantic production like this didn't have their core story / emotional arc figured out when it was months away from release,1
They just winged it for a long time until they had to do \_something\_ because delaying wasn't an option.,2

"Attack of the killer tomatos 1 and 2 trust me if you watched or trued watching the first movie and didn't like it the sequel is slightly more level headed for a movie of this style.

Nothing but trouble, yes it's not the greatest movie ever but man it's a fun goofy watch.

Dead alive (braindead) early Peter Jackson, it have one of the bloodiest endings I've ever seen, it's a zombie movie set in a Looney tunes world.",1

"Great songs just like the first (Into the unknown, Show yourself, The Next Right Thing)",1
It wasn't perfect but overall I really enjoyed it.,1
Bro it’s only part one,0
That’s why it said “to be continued”…..,0
"To be perfectly honest, based on what you described, it sounds like you need uplifting films, and that's a good thing!

You're close to my age, so look into stuff like sweet baseball movies such as ""The Sandlot"" (1993), or maybe a fun ride like ""True Lies"" (1994) where it's just Arnold blowing stuff up for two hours",1

- Little Lulu/Audrey
- Baby Huey
- The Stupidsticious Cat
- Popeye (Mainly the later theatrical releases, with the more fluid character animations).
- Grampy (they released the famous Christmas short in HD recently and it looks amazing!).
- Superman (not my favourite, but amazing none the less).
- The Enchanted Square (Highly recommended, bring tissues!).


Here are a few sample YouTube channels to check out if anyone has an interest in Golden Age animations and film preservation, Seth McFarland himself is in the middle of releasing old content again from the Fleischers too!

The Devils Advocate,0
Because of the Thrawn Trilogy,0
"Star Wars was dead until those books resurrected it, started the extended universe, and proved there was still money to be had",2
They were and still are better than any of the movies that followed them years later.,1
What made Disney movies so good is they were never targeted to specific ages,1
"Of course they were always ""family"" movies",0
They were targeted for all audiences not just kids,0
"There was crude humor that any adult would get, and more tame humor for the kids",1
Kids wouldn't understand the complexities of crude humor,2
"You can easily confirm this yourself when you go back and watch their older movies from pre-2013 (anything post-2013 IMO started to fall off drastically)

The issue is that kids nowadays are smarter, they understand the crude humor",1
They can't just use the same formula to make their movies accessible anymore,1
So instead they exclusively target people of ages that can't comprehend the humor,1
Making everything they make appear dull.,2
Abyss should be fine,1
Eddard Stark in Game of Thrones..,2
😇,0
This one is a maybe; but Kristen Stewart in The Clouds of Sils Maria,0
In that she literally vanishes while hiking mid-scene and didn't appear (or I don't think is even mentioned) for the rest of the film,0
I was like; what the hell just happened? She might have died or injured herself or just run off,0
But it really came out of nowhere.,1
"If I want a giant screen and sound with a leather recliner in a dark and quiet auditorium where I can focus completely on the film, I go to the theater",1
"If I want to sit on the couch and watch a movie on a TV that’s a fraction of the size of a theater screen in my cluttered living room that’s never quite dark enough with people wandering in and out and the phone ringing and kids interrupting the film and pausing it for various reasons and the dog barking, I’ll stay at home and be surrounded by distractions.",1
"Fair point, but the movie largely focuses on the female murderer, so yeah, is about lust largely",1
"Yo chill, my dad took my to see this when I was like 9, snuck into the theatre, movies strait fire and I won’t hear any alternate opinions.",0
nor ever rewatch it,0

With how up they are it's not even realistic that they could see the ground through those binoculars,1

This movie could have been absolutely incredible with a more cohesive story and better writing,1
As it stands it's a swing-and-a-miss.,0
"Loving Vincent is a new favorite of mine.
Some else mentioned triplets of Seville but it’s worth mentioning again",1
Belle is a newer one that has good animation and a great soundtrack.,1

Nic Cage is a brilliant actor! He faced financial problems when the real estate market took a dump,1
Many of us did,1
"He wanted to be honorable and not declare bankruptcy, so he took work that was offered",1
I admire him for that,0
"Even when he knew some material was subpar and he was grossly  underpaid on some of it, he worked his way through it",0
He put his whole self into each role even if it wasn't ocscar worthy material,1
He respects the craft and seems to have a good grasp on morality,1
I believe he gave each role his best,1
Life and the IRS can get in the way sometimes,0
Several of his current films are showing he's back!,0

Pretty soon we had piece-of-shit patrolmen trying to figure the job for themselves,1

"Weirdly enough, Michael Madsen's character in Thelma and Louise",2
He's definitely playing against type.,0
I remember this movie more from its ad on free Willy more than actually watching it.,1
It sounds like a question in high school philosophy filmed for 2 hours.,1
It was colour samples for repainting the boat house at Hereford.,0
Frank Gallagher surviving the apocalypse and aiding monkeys seems very on brand for him,1
You should check out loving Vincent!,1
"I don't remember Captain Stemkowski yelling, but ""No mercy"" definitely had some of that Dirty Harry vibe.",2
You are correct according to Google,0
Someone getting their ass kicked has never looked so good.,1

"Having watched Hellraiser for the first time recently, that explains a lot!",1

Yup,0
Own it on blue ray.,1
I have their season pass,0
I absolutely love Alamo,1
They feel run by people who actually love movies,1
The Breadwinner,0
Where did you watch it?,0
I watched this alone in a movie theater and it bummed me out for so many reasons (not just the obvious),1
"When I was a kid, I used to read Garfield comics religiously (along with Peanuts and Calvin & Hobbes), but besides the '80s cartoon and specials, none of the recent efforts to revive the character have ever seemed to get it right",1
I feel like they sanded down the edges here and made him as innocuous and dull as possible,2
"All the cutesy eye kitten stuff was okay, but besides that brief montage of him growing up, we don't really get to see too much of the true Garfield personality",1
"It also really bothered me that Jon Arbuckle was so estranged from the events of this film, since he's always been a big part of why the comics worked for me (the quintessential loser who is always trying to get Liz)",1
"I mean, I know it's a family movie designed to appeal to kids of all ages, so I'm not the target audience or anything",2
"But it just makes me feel so fucking old and obsolete when I think back to all those countless hours I spent invested in those comics and adventures, only for them to reinvent the mythos and throw out the ""canon.""

Another pet peeve is that a lot of it takes place on ""Lactose Farms"" (what a terrible, generic name), but they could have easily made it U.S",2
Acres and involved Orson & Friends if they really wanted to go in that direction,1
"But instead, we have this weird father-son dynamic that never existed in the comics and now seems to be a permanent staple of this new reboot.

Also, I don't know what voice Chris Pratt was trying to do here, but this wasn't it",2
And the fact that Samuel L,0
Jackson plays his pop is really weird,2
"Even Odie's characterization seemed to be off, but whatever",0
I don't know why I'm investing so much of myself into dumb shit,2
It's just a bummer all around.,0
The Warriors had some cool looking mofos for sure.,1
"I don't usually like dumb movies, but this one is surprisingly funny",1
"I did not have high hopes, but right after I watched it, I recommended it to my Mom.",1
They're closed minded and clearly have rough taste in movies,2
"I get the frustration, but let it go and watch on your own",1
"Nothing good will come out of forcing them to watch it or feeling resentful.

As for Carpenter's The Thing? It's a timeless classic with incredible effects, it's truly a must watch for horror fans and movie buffs.",1

"I miss the roller coaster!

"genuinely not think women are a minority? That men don't run the planet? Do you think 99% of world leaders have been men because men are naturally better leaders? Gimme a break lol

Btw, not sure why you thought I'd be against women in the draft, lol",1
"What are you, 40? I'm against the draft in general because I hate war but I don't see a reason it should be exclusively men

And honestly..",2
"no, I genuinely don't think there's anything men are required for in society aside from protecting us from other men",1
"Like genuinely, in an all-woman planet where we're reproducing on our own (which honestly we're not that far off from scientifically), what would we be unable to do?

What does it matter if male soldiers are stronger if there's no male enemy to fight, what does it matter if there are no male cops if there are no male criminals?

Men can't solve a single problem they didn't already cause (maybe boxing would be a little more boring?)

I don't know who ingrained into your head that women are ""ungrateful"" for what men give us, or that other women make you look bad (if you think other women being bad is a valid reason to look down on you, you've got some issues to work through)",2
George Clooney in From Dusk Till Dawn is a contender.,0

Not as horrendous as the thumbnail on this video.,0

Great flick,1
Thx for reminding me to rewatch!,0
The 4K is one of the worst out there,2
So much DNR that everyone looks waxy,1
Truly a benchmark in how not to do a 4K transfer.,0
"Haven‘t seen someone mentioning Nimona yet which i find a little bit sad tbh, it‘s such a good movie",1
I think people are deterred by the Netflix Original logo,1
"I’ll be honest, it’s a pretty good reveal, so I’d recommended watching it, and I probably won’t do a great job of explaining it.",1
"Have you watched Samurai Champloo? If not, I feel like you'd dig it a lot",0
"Judging from your list, we have somewhat similar tastes",0
"It's made by the same people as Cowboy Bebop, and while it's less known, I like it much much more.

And only like 20 episodes, so more accessible than a lot of longer running anime series.",1

But that's not what the movie is saying,0
"In the tv show, they are already getting buried alive by Mr Melancholy",2
"Maddy then digs herself out of the grave and is reborn, and goes back to try to help Owen do the same",0

Game Night,2
Exactly,1
The opening credits of Army of the Dead is a blast of a zombie short,2
I wish he would do lots of music videos and even commercials.,1
"I wouldn't say he is not given credit, he just never 100% focused on being a comedy actor.",0
I think it can be also be seen in a slightly more positive light,1
They're starting their new relationship already knowing what they could eventually hate about each other,2
"A lot of relationships start out wonderfully because you're blinded by the newness and excitement of the bond you're forming, so when the real and flawed person slowly gets revealed, you can start to resent them for not being the idealic person they never actually were. 


I think it'd actually be wonderful to start a relationship knowing that some things about the other person are going to drive you insane",1
"And to know what they are too. 


Of course, I think the ending could be interrupted way more pessimisticly too",1
But I like viewing it as a (mostly) happy ending.,1
"Dying young?

Julia Roberta Campbell scott?",1
"Lots of people here are talking about how great the sequels are, but you hit the nail on the head, they're like Saw sequels that you watch for a blood-splattery bit of action under an interesting but now slightly worn premise",1
"I mean, I *like* the films and find them incredibly watchable, but I wouldn't call them *quality cinema*",2

Some good taste right here!,1
The real hero here,1
"Ohhh, so true",1
Kinda broke my heart a bit since spectre and that final craig movie were so meh,0
Since the first three were just *so* good.,1
One of Orson's best films.,1
"If you are talking about the Step Printing (and perhaps even with the under-cranking on top) effect? With the blurry background (and slowmo foreground)?    
  

Tarantino used it in the intro shot to Reservoir Dogs",1
IIRC there a few shots in Saving Private Ryan here and there using Step Printing,2
A lot of Asian films employed the technique,1
I remember Millenium Mambo had a ton of it,0
And John Woo used it a few times.,2

The blue ray version had too much blue light,1

Aliens come from a 2k scan that was upscaled and DNRed.,0

Australia has such distinct  wildlife and wilderness its hard to pass of as another country,2
I see you got some Gaspar Noe movies in that list,0
I've watched all of his movies and all I can say is that he sure is a particular director,1

Jack Black is such a great comedic actor and not given the credit he’s due as a musician because he is a comedian.,1

"Do we need men to have a functioning society, Absolutely",1
Men do alot,0
You and all the women who think like you should be ashamed at how easily yall disregard all that men do for us,1
Let me say this now,0
This isnt some competition to me,0
We need each other to have a functioning society,2
"We complement each other. 


Well your point is ridiculous as giving birth and then taking multiple bullets or getting hit by multiple cars and still fighting is not the same thing",2
One is natural,1
One is not,0
"Also how well are women fighting after they give birth?! And how well would you fight after a broken rib, or a gun shot or two?! I am not only traditional",2
"I am a realist, not a crazy feminist",2
You sound like someone who has never been punched by a man,1
Also I am a twin,0
He is a male,0
I can see our differences and our strengths and we have the same parents and genes,0
Just because you want to live in some made up world where women are somehow superior and can do everything a man can doesn't mean you are living in reality,1
You are living in some make believe world you and other feminists prefer,2
But I like living in the real world where over 85% of our military and cops are male for a reason and this is with quotas and pushing for women to be represented,1
Women are not designed for intense combat,1
Can they do it,0
"Yes, but as well as a highly trained man",1
Absolutely not,2
They may be proficient in some areas but they will always lose in some aspect or another to a male counterpart,0
The packs they have to carry around alone in the military most women can't do for miles,1
Women have lost the ability to have children after the basic military training alone and thats not even combat,1
They have been known to lose weight and have severe medical issues while their male counterparts gained muscle mass,2
This isnt an attack on women,0
Stop taking it as that,0
It's biological,0
Men are built differently,0
Being offended is just ridiculous,2
Women are amazing but stop acting like they can do everything as well as men,1
Why men dont take us seriously,2
We literally can't,0
Or are you okay with women being drafted along side the men if a war breaks out?! You willing to sacrifice all women to prove your point that we are equal in this realm? This really shouldn't be controversial,1
It's our reality,0
If you honestly think a 120 pound female can take down 180 pound man you are just not thinking thru,1
Maybe train with men in sparring or boxing classes and come back and talk to me,0
Men and women are not equal,0
But by all means go ahead and fight some men and see how you end up,0
I'm sure you can break a couple of ribs or take a few gun shots and keep on swinging and win,1

Felidae

Anime anthologies - Neo Tokyo, Genius Party (avoid Limitcycle, I was told to avoid it, I didn't, now I'm telling you, avoid it!), Genius Party Beyond, Robot Carnival

"Keating is so full of resentment towards the school for having responsibility thrust upon him without his say so, he makes out that he loves teaching as a signal of virtue when underneath it all he is doing everything he can to subvert the pupils thereby destroying the institution from the inside.

If all his pupils flunked, I’m quite sure he would just shrug and pass it off with some smug smile, saying how “success isn’t measured in certificates”…",1
"I find him as charming as the devil himself, who couldn’t like him? But ultimately he is the snake in the grass, offering innocent boys the temptations of worldly pleasure and sowing the seed of resentment.

Is it not shown clearly as satanism, to sneak off at midnight under the moon to a dark cave, huddle round a fire and play with passions till demons are summoned? 

It is inevitable of course, everyone must go through this process, but for Mr",1
"Keating to have such hasty and lofty Pride over what is essentially just common Sin… There’s only one character in this life that is like that, and he has horns and a tail 😂

I do think that Mr,0
Keating’s approach is somewhat justified when dealing with a boy like Todd,1
He has issues and no relationship with his father at all,0
"He is lost completely.

In conclusion I do not believe that it is worth stirring the emotions and passions of already confused young boys just to save one lost soul.

Only satanists believe they have the authority to decide which child loses their life at the expense of another’s soul.

Whilst not implicitly responsible for Neil’s death and of course not legally, I do find Mr",2

You even admit it here *right after saying you didn't argue semantics*, you can't go a single sentence without contradicting yourself.

>how fucking stupid you are

As to your last paragraph, no, you don't get to tell me how I'm feeling or what I'd do, you don't know me",1

Making movies is really hard",2
"So many things can sabotage the project - not just the director or the executives, but simple things like a booking agent who didn't book big enough studios so the main set just feels tiny",1
"Or a makeup artists who made a continuity mistake with a scar.

One of the reasons I think people blame VFX/CGI a lot for films problems is that we are the people who are tasked with fixing problems after the fact",0
That scar on the wrong side? Have VFX fix it ..,2
but if you notice it's not quite real in one shot you'll blame it on bad CG,2
That set that is obviously CGI extensions? Have VFX fix it ..,0
"but the extensions may never feel right with the practical lighting that was shot for the tight space, so you'll blame it on bad CGI.

There was a time when we couldn't fix as much stuff",2
And I think that did honestly make us make better movies,1
"But good film makers, great directors and art directors and make up people and VFX people, still strive to plan and organise and do their best",1
"They don't want to ""fix things"" but instead to make the right thing to begin with.

But it is pretty hard",1
"Modern movies are big clunky things :)

I recently loved Everything, Everywhere, All At Once",1
"I think it was a modest budget, with a great story, and really cool CGI",1
It was done by a tiny little team and they did such great work ..,1
and they were able to do it because the Director cared and sat with the VFX artists and got really involved,1
"It was made with a plan, but was agile when it needed to be",0
"And it was made with connection, communication and passion",0
Making films like that is still hard ..,2

- so the american film company sued to either get the money, or have them kicked off the project

Birdboy: The Forgotten Children

My life as a zucchini",1
Never say never...,0
It sounds like an AI recorded the voice for this video.,0
Bro literally changed fashion and sensibility in a major way at that time,1
"Robot dreams is something that needs more attention, flat out one of the best films I've seen this year.",1
"In Time

The Purge",0
Well duh,2
They don’t make movies about losing teams,0
That’s not the point,0
I quite liked this one and getting to know all the characters,1
Sorry you didn’t.,2
"me, 6 months from your future............

mecha god dammit.",0
"That and Snatch, the gypsy Mickey O'Neil is one of his best roles in my opinion",1
"Every time I watch Hellraiser I swear I get some synthasia of knowing exactly what the set smells like, I can phantom smell like, the old wood aged with paint under hot lights plus like plaster and corn syrup",1
"I love how tangible and real the space is, but I also have real trouble seeing the art instead of the craft on that one especially.",1
Goat suggestion,0
How so? Seemed like a good movie to me,1
How was it haphazard?,0
"Im halfway through it and I don’t like it..
I love horror films but this one just isn’t good.",1
lots of stupid jump scares.,2
"nothing that’s actually scary.
That’s just my opinion..",2
"We only have Regal, where I live.",1
I think Charlize has a fairly American accent these days.,1
I watched it on Saturday and loved it so much I watched it again on Sunday,1
Not a thing I have done since the Avengers back in 2012,0
"I love Fury Road and it is the superior action movie, but I think Furiosa is the superior film.

For me it felt like a biblical story written for the end times",1
Or something in the vein of the Odyssey,0
"It all felt hilariously larger than life, like the history man wrote it all for posterity",1
"""And in his youth Dementus the Red led the great congress of destruction across the waste.""

Stuff like that just sticks with me",1
Or how the court of Imorten Joe is like a fucked up version of Olympus,2
"I don't know how many people got the same vibe out of this movie, but I am just silly grateful it exists.",1
"I CREATE LIFE >:(

…and I destroy it :)",2
Same,0
Yeah,0
I enjoyed it,1
Surprised to see its low ratings honestly,1
It was a beautiful movie and I felt for the characters,1
What else do they want from a sports movie?,0
!!!,0
My friends dad used to use black hawk down for this,2
If he closed his eyes and thought it sounded like a bullet really passed him,1
It passed,0
And any time the living room got rearranged the system needed to pass another tour in Somalia.,0
VelociPastor did a fantastic job at being an intentional campy ass low budget movie,1
Looks like someone asked Dall-E to make a poster for a generic Netflix show I’ll never watch,2
"Iron Giant, Titan AE, Triplets of Belleville, Shaun the Sheep",0
"You can't even decide on a numerical score, bwahahaha.

It was a 3",0
This movie was a strong 3.,1
Totally agree but originally from *Out of Sight*.,0
"Rewatched this a couple of months ago, it was better than I remembered, so anyone who hasn't seen it yet, give it a shot.",1
You Don’t Mess With the Zohan,0
You could tell that whole spinoff series was going to fail by looking at the Merch,2
"Like 2/3 of the Fantastic Beasts Merch had Daniel Radcliff, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint on them.

They aren't in the Fantastic Beasts movies, but the Merch worked hard to make you remember this was \*Harry Potter\* stuff",1
If they really believed in these films they wouldn't have felt the need to call back to the older films.,1
I thought he had a lot of expression,1
It’s in his eyes and his cute smile,1
He’s just an introvert so doesn’t talk much.,1
This was one of the least visually appealing movies I have ever seen.,1
It seemed obvious to me that he used to be on the team and was canned because he wouldn’t listen to the coach,0
The coach was giving him a second chance and told him not to screw up this time.,0
I love that movie,1
I feel like it's Cosplay the movie,0
Everything in that movie is designed in a specific way,0
Snyder really gets style.,1
"Nimona, over the garden wall",0
In Time is kinda Cyberpunk,0
More in the rusted undercity beneath the Cyberpunk utopia that exploits it vein like Elysium though.,1
The important scientist type guy from *World War Z* on the plane,1
They did him dirty on the accidental death front like the henchman guy on the staircase from *Out of Sight*.,2
I just finished Devolution,0
The last hour of that audiobook was fucking magical,1
I am recommending it to everyone,0
I hope the people who bought the movie rights learned from WWZ.,0
Yeah the character was named Sharon Stone,0
"You do realize this was based on a true story right? They weren’t just going to change who won the race, regardless",1
Had nothing to do with not wanting to show Germany winning,1
Germany really didn’t win.,1
The land before time is my favourite kids movie,0
I wore out a vhs tape from watching it so often.,0
I'm gonna swing big,0
Star Wars The Last Jedi,0
You had the chance to do anything,0
The prequels were gonna be the prequels cause they had to have a certain ending,1
JJ set this up as a softball to just make more bullshit star wars,1
He gave you a villain and some badass side characters with potential and a fucking droid almost better than R2 and...FUCK.,2
"- Quest for Camelot
- The land before time
- Shrek",0
"As heartbroken as Joel was at the start of the movie, as much as he wanted to forget he ever met Clementine, he started to treasure the memories he was losing.

I think the point of the movie was that relationships aren’t just defined by how they end, they’re defined by how we choose to remember them",1
"And I think that’s why they’re going to try again, even though they know how it ends.",0
"You gave it a numerical score three different times because this trash garbage shit movie baffled your attention span into malfunctioning in such a humorous way!

Woo",2
"Anything by Makoto Shinkai, although 5cm Per Second will probably stay my favorite",1
Don’t forget about My Father’s Dragon.,0
This and Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron,0
They really committed to an aesthetic.,1
"A lot of the ones people have already mentioned, but some I haven't seen are:

The Adventures of Tintin (2011)

The Legends of Vox Machina

Spider-man: Into the Spider-Verse (although that may be considered Disney given Marvel's involvement)

Fantastic Mr Fox

Loving Vincent",1
"The irony of being willing to watch it over and over is rich.

Kind of like being a fan of “Groundhog Day.”",1
You can still enjoy it as a narrative,1
"No movie is true to life, much less biopics",1
I love The Doors but still loved that movie growing up despite doing Morrison absolutely dirty.,1
"Since no one else mentioned it in doubting myself whether this qualifies: I, Robot.",0
"Haven't seen Ugly Americans, but Bojack Horseman, lol, hell yes!",1
Your review here says so much about why cinema appeals in some way to at least a portion of the possible viewing audience!,1
"Laika animation, Don Bluth",0
How was my post a slight against her? It's just a question.,2
Loads of people didn’t like the movie BUT.,0
Ghostbusters Afterlife…in the end…I didn’t tear up.,0
"She was so hot in it, lord almighty.",1
"That's my puppy's name, she's pretty sweet.",1
What the FUCK! Are you telling me that movies aren't real life? My whole life is a lie now.,2
My favorite name! A woman named Trish is a woman you can count on,1
All this Barb & Star talk has reminded me: I need to stock up on some new culottes for summer.,1
"I know a lot of people consider it the easy best of Disney's Star Wars movies, but: Rogue One.


The movie could have been a space noir detective/heist film of discovering the location of the Death Star blue prints and covertly stealing them",1
"Instead, we get a bland fetch quest, with an admittedly great Vader hallway scene to let a good taste in everyone's mouth leaving the theater to make them remember fondly a sub-mediocre film.",1
Around 18m mark.,0
Borderline? Shit...are you telling me you didn't walk out 45 minutes in?,2
"I recently watched Nimona on Netflix and that was excellent! The Sea Beast is on there also, and very satisfying.

Honorable Mentions:
Fantastic Mr",1
"Fox
Sinbad
Castlevania
Legend of Vox Machina
Frieren
Apothecary Diaries
Belle
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs
Shrek",0
"I didn't expect to see Connor O'Malley in this, but I definitely laughed when I wasn't supposed to a couple of times",1
Esp the birthday song enthusiasm,0
I almost want to say this is a AI written review.,0
Speak for yourself,0
It was my introduction to this story and I liked it just fine,1
7/10,0
I may read the book too and I’m sure it fills out more details but I really quite enjoyed the movie,1
No complaints really.,1
How full was ur session?,1
It's on youtube,0
Maybe it's because Halle Berry was biracial and wore wigs of white-style hair but she always appealed to everyone,0
Her draw was always more than merely being pigeon holed into 'black actress'.,1
OP if you want to go see a movie in theaters for the experience then just go,1
If you feel like it then don't,0
I skip most movies since they don't interest me but often enough I'll find a movie I LOVE and am willing to see like 4+ times because it's so fun,1
"I have the AMC stubs membership thing which is $26/mo for 4 free tickets a week, shits great literally just 2 screenings a month makes it worth it to me",1
I saw dune two eight times and am seeing Furiosa a 3rd time tomorrow,0
Just check rotten tomatoes and metacritic before seeing a movie if you're worried it'll be bad,2
"Most movies do suck, most of everything sucks",1
"But if you haven't seen a movie since 2019 I truly do pity you for missing out on premiere night at the cinema for movies like Dune 1 & 2, Spider-Man No Way Home, Spider-verse 2, Barbenheimer, Everything Everywhere All At Once, etc...",2
This is why we keep getting remakes and sequels,0
Dumbass articles like this.,0
"So...you hated the movie, but want to be polite about it",2
Me too!,0
"Rise of skywalker was a shit movie and JJ is a shit director, but there was literally nowhere to go after TLJ because Rian Johnson burnt down every story arc in his meta tantrum",2
You had to reintroduce a new plot and wrap up a trilogy simultaneously,1
"It was an impossible task.

Imagine if you will for Return of the King: Sauron is dead (after being humiliatingly defeated), Gandalf is dead (after being put through a struggle session), all of the fellowship are dead, the shire was destroyed offscreen",2
Rohan and Gondor are both wiped out offscreen,0
The ring was actually useless and never important to begin with,2
The only main character left is Eowyn and some extras,1
What do you do for the 3rd film?,0
I’m Gonna Git You Sucka,0
Scrolled way too far to find Akira being listed.,1
Just tell them it’s live action Amogus.,1
You watched the entire thing? Wow...,1
Storks,0
"Went in not knowing what to expect and it was great!



Other recommendations I'd have I've already seen mentioned.",1
"That's one thing I love about this movie, even though it's sort of a Boogie Nights cautionary tale in a lot of ways, it does have this really inspiring can-do attitude and this very pure hearted childlike joy at movies that got really lost in the cynicism of the 1970s (and even more so today), but you can actually physically feel it in movies from the 1920s-40s they have a real earnestness about them that almost comes off as sort of cringe",1
Miyazaki does this a lot too,0
I think it's just a cultural thing.,1
The sequel Trinity is Still My Name (1971) is also good.,1
You should start watching good movies.,1
I really wanted to like this,1
"Cobbler and the Thief 

Heavy Metal 

Paprika

Angels Egg

Secret of Kells

Perfect Blue

Fantastic Planet

AKIRA 

Hedgehog in The Fog",1
"People only defend it because they either don’t like Star wars to begin with and the entire movie is a meta essay on why Rian Johnson hates Star Wars, or because of the greater twitter war where they have to support their camp",1
"Haha nice, thoughts?",1
"Believe it or not, they weren't legally allowed to market this as a movie in Australia.",1
The whole motorcycle gang going in circles around Furiosa didn’t notice her cutting her arm off and escaping?,1
This was one of my favor movies growing up so I was really excited to see this,1
I compared this movie to the remake of Overboard in the way that a lot of the time it felt like the timing and pace was off,1
"It felt like they were just trying to hit certain plot points and didn’t get there right with the lines or organically, which made a lot of scenes feel awkward and out of the blue and out of place and random",1
It was missing a lot of cinematic magic,1
The fashion was not there,0
In the original movie we really did see Sue Ellen and Kenny grow and mature become more responsible and adult like and really taking care of the younger the siblings,1
I didn’t get that in the remake.,0
Godzilla (2014) the atomic breath scene,0
Scott Pilgrim,0
Either Spiderverse movie,0
The soundtracks are phenomenal.,1
He has a few good ones,1
Poor guy,2
"He just wanted to be ""an official couple."" Is that too much to ask?",1
The score was bad.,2
Thanks so much! That cast is exquisite,1
10/10,0
"A Scanner Darkly.

Has that same surreal rotoscoped vibe as the third on your list, Waking Life, which is an amazing film too.",1
Don't Be Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood,0
The OST is 🙌🏻,0
"Fun fact, the writers of this film did a very clever thing for this movie by choosing to introduce each character via a bit of narrative shorthand for modern audiences. 


Ex: Lugosi is introduced in a coffin, Elvira is first seen on a campy TV program, the wrestler guy is introduced in a wrestling ring.",1
"I've seen all but never finished the Lincoln Lawyer series, only the movie",0
I've also read a few of The Lincoln Lawyer books.,2
There’s been group conflict in the Middle East for hundreds of years,0
Even the Palestinian/Jewish conflict goes back hundreds of years.,0
"Primal

It's so good, a caveman and dinosaur fight everything, no dialog, just epic and bloody dinosaur battles",1
2 seasons,0
Those tattoos too,0
I'm straight but man he makes me question myself in that movie lmao,1
Nothing about that movie was important,1
"A crass, unfunny money grab",0
Pod racing scene in The Phantom Menace is the first thing I play after ant adjustment/additions to my setup,1
For me it’s “a good question for another time” or “kill the past”.,1
"I think that one could be interpret as probably a dream sequence, the end of that movie sort of flies off the rails and they become more delusional",1
I liked Halle's role because she was just a secretary that wasn't exoticised for her skin colour or ethnic background,1
Her character simply existed like the rest of Bedrock,0
That's how representation ought to be done in a nutshell.,0
Arcane,0
That is all.,0
This is just gross and sad to see,2
"More poor, sloppy, use of AI that shows how terrible it is to use",2
"Reminds me of the special edition of the Star Wars trilogy, where Lucas was wowed by the advancement of CG at the time and used it to make his movies worse.

These 4k remasters might be worse though, because at the very least, as misguided as it was, the Star Wars special editions were done from a purposeful, creative, point of view, compared to these remasters being done to save money and release it faster.

\*EDIT\* And the Lucas bit was brought up later in the video too, so on the same page there it seems lol",1
This is one of my favorite Rom-coms of all time!! Hilarious,1
*obligatory scrolled so far to find this one,1
Recency bias but Civil war could have been an all timer if it was an action that was remotely similar to the trailer,1
"It was a decent film but the premise of of tx,ca,fla vs USA modern civil war film right now is free money",1
I agree and it's actually wild to me how many self-proclaimed huge Tim Burton fans haven't even heard of it.,1
it's kind of sad,2
"Its also one of my favorite movies about friendship and drug addiction, a weirdly forward thinking/progressive movie for it's time and setting. 


And yes I can totally confirm that no film captures the desperation of low-budget filmmaking quite like that scene towards the end where Martin Landau has to get in that freezing water and wrestle a fake octopus. 


I'd also go so far as to say it's my favorite Johnny Depp performance (easily), up there with Fear and Loathing and Dead Man.",1
I watched it on Amazon,0
I personally find it sad,2
"Yeah it’s sweet they wanna go around again, but they weren’t compatible in the first place and are destined for failure",1
Maybe it’s part of my pessimistic outlook on relationships but it just felt hopeless to me.,0
"The only redeeming quality is that it’s the ONLY movie with a legit, non-edited _BRRRRRRRRRT_ sound of the M61 Vulcan rotary cannon",1
"Oh, and one of the F-14s stalled and almost fell into the ocean",1
"I swear, the less I hear those BRRRRRRT the more I’m convinced General Electric patented the sound just like Harley-Davidson did for their bikes.",1
Loved it,1
"Tight, tense, focused thriller, with a great pair of lead kids, and Kevin Bacon puts in a great performance.",1
Nice roster of movies already,1
"Adding two that I haven't seen listed:

- Zoolander (2001)
- Kick-Ass (2010)",0
"TLJ is Star Wars for people who hate Star Wars, and a giant meta commentary on why the director hates Star Wars",2
It’s bizarre Disney allowed it to be part of their big budget trilogy,1
"As a member of the hardcore fan base, I can tell you that it was the moment we all checked out and simply became apathetic to Star Wars as a brand after that point",2
"When we become less toxic a society and the damage control media shield behind TLJ is lifted, It’ll go down in history as a legendary blunder that helped put Disney in its current crisis.

A good litmus test for this movie is for someone to defend it without insulting or bringing down other Star Wars movies",2
I’ve never seen it done except for when the defender is made aware of it.,1
"I didn’t see any of these but there are to so many comments (and great suggestions), apologies if they are duplicates: 

[Senseless](https://youtu.be/A6pM-4m7xQ0?feature=shared)

"Don't feel bad, the prequel film a couple years later was so awful that it made everyone forget about the first.",2
It’s just papyrus IN BOLD,1
Wallace and Gromit,0
"Saw the Last Unicorn with my mom when I was ten or eleven, it was amazing",1
"Terrifying, but amazing.",1
"Sorry, I'm a little late:
Swiss Army Man",2
"Jurassic World: Dominion, 5000%.",0
I think it’s from late 2000’s,2
King Fury,0
The dude had it coming though,0
Him and that robot fighting did do a lot of property damage,1
"I mean, they fucked up the Hubble…",2
...And then Catwoman happened.,0
That new interview with the vampire show,1
Annoying,2
Sorry,2
Not even a movie,0
"Late but I’m also in the same year+ long wait club!

I first heard about it over in /r/horror, or the “bloody disgusting” website",2
"Great sources for upcoming movies worth keeping your eye out for, the next one on the docket that I’m especially excited about is Longlegs!",1
"Please Don't Destroy: The Treasure of Foggy Mountain

Honestly one of the most recent so dumb it's actually fucking hilarious I've seen in a long time

And to add in one of my all time favorites...Bio-Dome",1
Book of Life (2014),0
Why are you being so aggressive about something as subjective as movie interests? It's not like I said either of those were bad.,2
Basically her naiveté is attractive to a certain kind of man who romanticize innocence in women as the greatest virtue,1
"She’s the polar opposite of Kathryn, , kind, sweet, innocent, not a single manipulative bone in her body and sexually inexperienced",1
"Sébastien has to trick her and get her drunk to get her to sleep with him initially and then Kathryn basically tells her to throw her box at every man who shows interest, so she can ruin her innocence",2
She’s Kathryn's true foil in the film,1
Attractive and doesn't know or use her sexualty to get what she wants,1
And yet still gets her guy in the end because they love each other,1
Meanwhile Kathryn is denied her final revenge because Cecile was too dumb to recognize that she was being manipulated until Sébastien dies and by then Annette already read the journal and told her what was really going on,2
TLDR her idiocy is exaggerated to contrast the over the top villainy of Kathryn,1
And because the plot requires it,0
It's the weakest part of the story imo as someone who loves this movie.,1
Prometheus 4K Blu-ray is absolutely spectacular.,1
Really liked how Disney didn't and still doesn't overtly give the female animals' designs to resemble women like plenty of other animated movies from other studios,1
"I wasn't sure if Terk was a guy or a girl, and after looking it up? Apparently she's the latter.

I've never really understood why it's done unless it's done for comedy like those Orangina commercials.",2
The hype for this movie was unreal,1
The campaign was so much better than the actual movie,1
I remember a collective “wtf was that” from people in the theater when the credits rolled.,2
"This seems to be a daily question here now.

I think people are more selective on which movies they want to watch.

Cost of living crisis and abundance and convenience of streaming options are also factors.

And superhero movie fatigue",1
"But I will probably watch Deadpool and Wolverine.

And then there are the cell phone users and anti social behavior of fellow cinema goers.",1
"I think they made lots of changes, including to Joel and Clementine! But it's always funny to see what stays and what goes 😊",1
"First, they would assemble a crew, including actors, a writer (or writers), camera operators, craft services and a director",1
"In preproduction they would come up with a list of shots they would need to shoot and a timeline to shoot it in.

At this point they will choose if they want Behemoth to be practical effects or CGI or a combination of the two",1
"They will do this with other shots too.

Once that is done, they can go into production where they would point the camera at the actors and have them act out the script",2
"Once they filmed everything (or wrapped, in industry speak), they will go into post production where they will edit the footage together and add all the needed digital effects",0
At this point they might show it to the studio and producers,0
Reshoots may be needed and usually are,2
"This is called post production.

So basically the same way they make any movie.",0
Lol! I getcha! I'm just jelly of all these gorgeous bastards being mentioned ITT xD,1
"Time for some friends who have more open minds? More of a sense of adventure? More willingness to indulge some of your interests instead of only their own?  

They sound more like casual friends as opposed to good ones",1
The Thing (original one) is a genuinely scary movie,1
The setting and atmosphere are the reason it has enduring popularity to this day.,1
I learned today he kissed a 12 yo girl in The Beguiled,0
That had to solidify his Republican credentials!,0
This is what I liked about the Fall Guy,1
"Lots of real stunts enhanced by CGI removing the wires or changing the backdrop, but not trying to create the whole stunt on a computer. 

And the meta aspect was fun",1
"Showing us how they digitally map the actors’ face on to the stunt man, and then having “Ryan Gosling” do the stunt in front of us immediately after. 

They tell us exactly how they’re going to trick us",1
"And then still trick us. 

Movie magic.",1
"Funny enough, Sherlock Holmes",1
The surround sound from the rear speakers as horses clip-clop through London from one side to the other is as clear as day,1
"Great film for ambient sound and clearly showing off how objects transition through the 3D space.

As a bonus, it's a Hans Zimmer soundtrack as well so of course you have that to look forward to.",1
Our society celebrates disorder,0
"Michael Jai White in Black Dynamite.

""I threw that shit before I walked in the room!""",2

and so is the live action version.,1
The Mitchells vs the Machines was a genuine delight.,1
Well this comment age very well,1
"Agree completely

You Name is devastatingly good

Arcane is a miracle",1
I still don't understand how they managed to get animation like that..,0
at all,0
Let alone for a TV show.,0
"Didn't even process that when watching the movie, was waiting to see when that happens and once it did I was like ""thats it?""",0
Yesh,0
"It’s interesting too because Marco and Polo’s dance scene is so adjacent to like…a V/H/S one-off bit of scariness, but it doesn’t go full tilt, so it still feels initially goofy",1
How unfortunate,2
Yes,0
It's a very good film.,1
"It's the atmosphere, the plot is good even though it makes up like only 40% of the film",1
"It's the atmosphere and the music right from the opening scene, the dystopian vibes you get from a city packed full of people like when you see the montage of the city and ultimately makes you question the purpose of life",1
What do you do when you're just a ghost in a shell?,0
"Fern Gully
Rockadoodle
Fievel Goes West
Rescuers Down Under
Thumbellina
All Dogs Go To Heaven",2
Pretty much all of the DC animated content,1
"Whether it's batman, superman, justice league, or the animated movies, it's all so much better than the live action content.",1
