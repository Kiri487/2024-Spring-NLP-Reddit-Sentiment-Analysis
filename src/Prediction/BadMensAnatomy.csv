"The prostate in males is homologous to the Skene's gland in females, the latter being in the ""G-spot"" region.

As such, the Skene's gland is often called the ""female prostate"", and inversely, the prostate is often called the ""male G-spot"".

It is however not *in* the butt.

It's just the shortest distance you can touch it through the rectal wall, as used in prostate exams or sexual stimulation.",1

"For example if you're in a relationship, you could see an attractive women and get a boner but assuming you're faithful, you wouldn't want to sleep with her.

Or even if you're single, you probably don't want to sleep with every single person you find attractive, even if they're attractive enough to give you a boner",1

You've asked the same question four times now,0
You're bordering on not understanding it to the point that you might act inappropriately if you see a man adjust himself,0
You need to understand this: JUST BECAUSE A MAN HAS AN ERECTION DOES NOT MEAN HE WANTS TO HAVE SEX WITH ANYONE AROUND HIM,1
STOP ASKING,0

DON'T ASSUME ANYTHING ABOUT ANYONE AT ANY TIME,0

"I mean it's satire obviously, right? Right...?",2
"I looked at your post history, and it seems that you are insecure in your current relationship, or he's yelling you stuff and you don't believe it",2
Maybe you should do some deep reflection instead of asking all these questions.,0
Why do you keep asking after you get an answer,0
I got a boner replacing my garbage bag this morning,0
Stupid sexy garbage,2
"No they just happen for literally whatever reason, things you find attractive just fall under whatever reason",1
They also don't always happen when you want to have sex because fuck you that's why.,2
"We get boners at random, like morning wood

A boner don't necessarily mean we want to sleep with someone",2
"Men can lose their boner when they wanna sleep with a woman

This made me have testicular cancer and double it for the next person,0
"Again, no, because he can get erect for any reason",0
"Sometimes it does, maybe even most of the time, but definitely not always",1
.....🤮 I shouldn't have read that 🤣.,0
"But if he sees a woman that he finds attractive and gets hard, does it always mean he’s being horny?",2
"Guys can get hard from being horny, but penises can become erect for any number of reasons so you can't assume that an erection means the guy is horny",2
The worst ones are middle of the school day and you have to get up in front of everyone to give a presentation and are wearing right pants,2
So you mean that if he sees an attractive women and gets hard does not indicate that he’s horny,2
i seriously hope this shit is a troll,2
Yea ..,0
no one is having an orgasm if kidney stones are involved.,0
No because boners know no logic,0
They happen whenever wherever.,0
I didn't know that men ejaculated until I flipped my shit because my dick was vibrating and giving me a heart attack.,2
"No, not necessarily; these things can just happen",0
Angry boners are confusing,2
Nope,0
"It most likely means he’s attracted to her, but not necesssrily that he wants to actually sleep with her.",1
"Men can get boners for absolutely no reason, so not necessarily",2

"Over all reads like r/WomenWritingMen and r/menwritingwomen at the same time? out of boxing experience, how does one punch a nose hard enough to make it red as blood without it just being blood?

r/lostredditors If this really happened or r/everybodyclapped if it didn't,1

Only 19 but on karate for decades?,0
"Good point, but what's this got to do with bad men's anatomy?",2

"I think you’re right about this because it seems like the person in the post thinks waist to hip ratio is determined by width, but it’s actually determined by circumference",1
So most men don’t have a 1:1 hip to waist ratio.,1
"Low effort comment right there mate, go out and get some fresh air",1
There hasn’t been any studies for the optimal ratio for men,0
They only know it should be .9 or LESS,2
"No, no, this is the opposite of true!",1
Math for bodies is… not good,2
Research has been done on this actually,0
"The ""most attractive"" ratio was found to be about 7:10, or a waist that is about 70% the width of the hips, at least for women",1
For men it's 9:10.,0
Why are you in an anatomy subreddit if you don't care,0
"Under 9 is the medically correct answer, but lower than that means you are fit",1
This actually looks comfortable,1
"The younger you are, the more your penis bends upward like that, so it's better for younger people",1
I pre-answered someone's question,0
You don't get it? 1:1 waist to hip ratio is impossible unless you are overweight,2
"This sub, like its more famous counterpart BadWomensAnatomy, is for people being wrong about anatomical facts, not subjective things like attractiveness.",1
So what would be the correct ratio?,0

Anyone who's uncut knows that you can retract the foreskin and the glans underneath is VERY SENSITIVE,1
Meanwhile cut guys have their glans rubbing against their underwear all day cutting down on sensitivity.,2
I too consistently shed my dick skin.,0
"soooo does the 'shiny, moist and glistening' effect of 'just having had a layer of skin removed' last a lifetime or do you need to keep getting skin removed regularly? or are they only talking about people (mostly babies) immediately after the procedure ? in which case I'd think yeah they are likely to be very sensitive at that time because they're in pain ? if you cut the skin off your face it's probably going to feel sensitive too but there is no reason to do that.

The varying factors are everything but height.,0
Yeah just the days vary and they‘re stupid as shit,2
"They‘re either the same 3 days spread over a week or 3 consecutive days, which is probably the worst idea for a workout routine",2

The difference between American women and straight guys vs,1
"gay/bi guys here is pretty interesting to me.

Gay/bi guys generally love uncut, some to the point of having a fetish for them lol

I guess it just confirms to me that women and straight guys are pretty clueless about dicks in general (other than their own).

Cut straight guys will think cut is better and uncut is weird or gross because they only know their own.

American women often think uncut is gross either because they have no experience with them, or they're blindly repeating things they've heard from friends or movies/TV.

Oddly, most American women who think it's gross have never actually been with an uncut guy.

One of my friends was dating a girl for 2 years before she even knew he was uncut, because she never really saw him soft lol",1

"What area was this in?

The rates vary widely in the US, but the overall trend is that it's becoming less common.

It's still pretty common in the midwest, but much less common in the northeast and west coast.

Humans evolved to have the nerves be in the foreskin, and not so much in the glans.

https://youtu.be/CGYq1n6Ipfw?t=2701

To summarize, humans share common ancestors with chimps and rhesus monkeys.

Rhesus monkeys have almost all the innervation in their glans, have short copulatory times, and the male invests nothing into the offspring.

Chimps have less innervation in their glans and more in their foreskin, they have longer copulatory times than rhesus monkeys, and the male invests in the offspring by providing protection for his tribe.

Humans have almost all the innervation in the foreskin, they have the longest copulatory times of all the primates, and the males invests the most in their offspring out of any animal.

And if an **American Academy of Pediatrics boardmember hoodwinked parents to normalize his own religious ritual as a medical benefit** (https://youtu.be/FCuy163srRc?t=4284), that seems shady to say the least and criminally negligent.

"It's also pretty wild when Americans talk about having a preference for a circumcised penis, it's sort of like saying that I prefer women who had her nipples removed or some other body part chirurgically altered",1

Genuine question: What is OP's obsession with posting things about circumcision? Did his own circumcision go horribly wrong and now OP can't feel anything at all or is he just overreacting to something that changes nothing about your life?,2
For a long while I was so confused on why hospitals/doctors push to have it done but then I realized they make money off of it,2
"I’m pretty sure if it didn’t make them money/if people didn’t believe them, circumcision would have been stopped long ago",1
But because it can get the drs/hospitals extra money it’s always heavily being pushed by them,2
It also doesn’t help that a lot of guys who are circumcised don’t want to admit/accept that they were mutilated without their consent and were powerless to stop it,2
In addition to a lot of women outright saying that uncut guys are disgusting compared to cut guys.,2
Because it is non-consensual mutilation that stems from body shaming founded on outdated and medically incorrect believes.,2
"I’ll say it again, as a non-American the idea of cutting the foreskin off a brand new baby at birth is just astonishingly weird and disturbing.

There most definitely is,1
"""Should I cut off part of their genitals"" should never be a question in a parent's mind when they learn they're having a baby boy, the same way that question would never pop in their head if they were having a girl",0
"The potential benefits of it is the thing most widely debated, since the morality is pretty cut and dry: removing normal, healthy body parts unnecessarily is immoral",1
"And the benefits argument can be broken down to the fact that all of the benefits are either so insignificant that they're irrelevant, or can be achieved through less invasive and more effective means.

Cutting infants genitals is not something that should ever need to be discussed or thought about",1
"The right to bodily autonomy and integrity are some of the most integral that there are, and if you don't even have that then what exactly do you have? As far as issues go, it's incredibly black and white.",1
Male circumcision is a good example of how culture persists and how that is completely irrational,1
"Originally it was to prevent masturbation, but by the time people realized that was never going to work there was already a generation of men that were largely circumcised",1
These men and their wives decided circumcision was normal,1
"Because of sexual stigma there was no rational discourse over whether this was a good idea or not, just the accusation that the other kind of penis was weird and gross",1

A popular cope by circumcision proponents is that it has no effect on sexual experience.

Death grip style masturbation is often blamed for cut men complaining of not being stimulated enough with sexual intercourse alone or even blowjobs.

Depending on the cut, no two man loses the same amount of tissue",1
There are men who end up with a tight cut style,2
"When erect, their shaft skin is taut and can be painful and prone to tears",2
The scrotum skin and pubic skin may be pulled up along the shaft to compensate for the erection expanding it,0
There are men who end up with a loose cut style,2
"As opposed to tight cut men who require some form of artificial lubrication to facilitate comfortable stimulation, loose cut men have enough slack skin after erection to simply grip and move up and down",2
"This frictionless movement is default for the intact penis, and the potential for how much the shaft skin can extend will depend on the extent of the excision of the foreskin",1
"The foreskin acts as a plug at the vaginal/anal entrance, to keep lubrication fluid inside, which then gets redistributed by the glans as it re-enters the vaginal/anal cavity",0
"A loose cut style may retain some of this functionality, but it cannot ever be as fully functionable as in its original form",1
A tight cut penis essentially acts like a piston with a flared out corona on the glans that scoops out lubrication with each outstroke and dries it out on the shaft,2
There is another factor to consider: high vs low style of cuts,0
"A high style is a cut made further along the shaft, somewhere midway, leaving a lot of sensitive inner foreskin past the glans until the circumcision scar",1
The frenulum may also be kept mostly intact but will always depend on the surgeon’s performance and preference of circumcising,1
An exposed frenulum remnant may lead to premature ejaculation as it cannot modulate the stimulation the foreskin previously provided,2
"A low style tries to remove as much inner foreskin as possible, putting the shaft skin right up to the glans, to almost hide the circumcision scar under the corona",1
The frenulum and frenular delta are gone.,0
"While I agree that circumscision should be consentual as an adult rather than as a child, I dont understand what the issue itself is outside of not being able to consent as a baby.

"A five-year-old boy climbed up onto the roof of a medical clinic to try and avoid being circumcised.


The boy had been taken by his parents for the operation, which is common in Indonesia.

He ran away up to the roof, where he stayed for two hours as people tried to persuade him to come down.

Dr Anik Sutari said she had never seen anything like it during her years of practice in the city of Serang, capital of Banten province, on the island of Java.

She shared the photograph of the boy’s stunt on Facebook on July 8 and admitted she had been stumped as to what to do.

Dr Sutari said: ‘Throughout my professional history, out of the 20 years I have been doing circumcisions and the thousands of children I have circumcised, this is the first time I’ve seen a child flee to the top of the roof.’

She and the boy’s parents had been reluctant to follow the frightened youngster onto the roof in case he tried to run away and fell.

The boy finally came down after his parents thought to contact his schoolteacher who had a good relationship with him.

She added: ‘It’s true… As soon as the teacher comes, with a little persuasion finally the child wants to come down…

‘And even more magical, the child walks himself to the circumcision clinic, and positioned himself for the procedure without being led or forced.’

And Dr Sutari said the boy did not struggle, cry or even complain when she was finally able to circumcise him – three hours later than planned.

Most Indonesian boys are circumcised around the age of five.

The practice is particularly prevalent among Muslims who make up the vast majority of the islands’ population.

"They started with the same chances as anybody else.


They just made choices in their life to make it more difficult to naturally do so.


In a sense, either making themselves a non desirable partner to get married to & raise a family with or making themselves infertile.


Some people made no choices like that and were naturally infertile or had genetics that make in inadvisable to have kids.


If their drive & dedication is strong to create an environment to raise a child, adoption is an option.


Not easy, and more jumps to get through but usually possible.


Some people foster children also.


It has to be an environment though that is healthy & conducive to having a baby in though.


Steady employment, safe environment etc, no illegal activity/drug use, etc.",1

"Considering that some males lactate on heavy duty anti psychotics, because they have pituitary tumors, or lactate after being in starvation that causes prolactin levels to rise.


Others that are into male lactation take something called dophamine sp?


That is cardiotoxic to a babies heart.


Among other herbs or medications that are not safe for babies.


Females really have to be careful what medications they are on while breastfeeding, because a lot, most get transfered to breast milk.


Men do not normally produce breast milk & when they do, it is under rare circumstances that also make it unsafe for a baby in various ways.


So...ok....you want to make a point about something or another of a uncommon unusual happening.


But it is supposed to be about the welfare of the baby and not making a point about things.


Those that say they are ""naturally"" doing it....I don't believe they are.


I think they use herbs & other medications to stimulate it that can be harmful or effect the development of the baby from the herbs & medications in the breast milk.",1

I mean didn't they teach this in Jebus Studies?,2
Why do they think this? Reference to how god took one of Adam's ribs to make eve? Or are they trying to say men evolved to have one less rib so they can suck their own dick?? I'm so confused,2

"To me size does matter! Sorry boys!  Even if a man is skilled with his hands and tongues instill have a deep desire to be taken and feel filled.

I do not orgasm from penetration still the feeling of him inside me feels good",1
"It feels like he owns me.

I must have been lucky cause all my relationship partners have penis between 6.6 and 7.9 inches and it felt fucking good,1
"Damn, I hope so! I just meant that the foreskin isn't dead skin, it's pretty sensitive.",1
And unfortunately it's not just a yank obsession,2
Every time I've been with a man (who were all uncut) the foreskin goes back as if it is circumcised once they are erect anyway,0
"That’s really great information, thank you! My partner is looking into restoration himself,  hearing that you’ve passively achieved some progress is really encouraging",1
It’s amazing what the body can do.,1
"Wow, I didn’t even know that was an actual thing.

Probably not exactly the same thing, and possibly TMI, so i apologize in advance, but I actually greatly improved sensitivity and loosened the skin there by changing the way I masturbate",1
"Instead of using lube and focusing on the head, I learned and trained myself to take it slow, not use lube at all, and masturbate solely by moving the skin along the shaft with a loose grip",2
"So it actually has some degree of glide during masturbation/sex at least.

Definitely going to do more looking into that tho",1
"Thank you.

Edit: it actually did take years of doing that to see that great increase of sensitivity",1
"May not be related to foreskin restoration, but I do believe circumcised penises tend to allow/encourage you to masturbate in ways that ruin your sensitivity due to that lack of natural glide.",1
Oh wow!,1
Foreskin restoration is an option but it can take a lot of time depending on how much you want to restore,1
It’s just routine stretching exercises or a stretching device but I can’t vouch for the safety of the second option,0
You can’t get the same structures that were removed back but you can loosen the skin to provide more glide,1
Some guys commit to it for years and achieve full glans coverage but they don’t have a sphincter at the end anymore so that’s a factor to consider if you ever want to go for it,1
It’s not quite an undo button but it’s an option to look into if that’s something you want,0
The user Uncutting (on tumblr of all places) wrote a blog detailing their experience with full restoration and included pictures,1
It was fascinating to read.,1
I had sex ed in four different southern states (military kid) and the foreskin was never mentioned at all,2
Lots of STD pictures though.,1
The “I can clean it faster” point doesn’t really matter when you consider the foreskin is fused to the head during the period of life where the penis will frequently be covered in waste,1
"Cleaning it is the exact same as a cut penis at that age and you don’t have to deal with keeping a circumcision wound from getting infected while they’re liquid-pooping every 2-3 hours.

Caring about cleaning it a few seconds faster as an adult seems like a reach to find a benefit, imo.",1

"I think I got lucky, cuz although I’m circumcised, I’m still very sensitive, maybe just as sensitive…but that’s the fun part, I’ll never know what it’s supposed to feel like and if there actually is a difference or not",1
"Hearing women’s reasoning for why they prefer uncircumcised penises also kinda hurts because it makes me question if my wife is missing out on something and if our sex life would be even better had I not been circumcised, but I’ll never know",1
"I didn’t get the decision to keep it or not, and I can’t undo what was done",0
"However, any boys I have will not be circumcised, and will instead be taught the importance of proper hygiene and how to conduct it, which means I’ll also have to learn how to clean a uncircumcised penis, cuz I don’t have one.",1
"And then when people rightfully call out circumcision, they come back with ""why are you always thinking about kids genitals?"" There is no topic where people just absolutely shut their brains off more than infant circumcision",1
"I mean, it has to be that way for something so barbaric to be culturally normalized.",2
"Not quite as stupid as saying it has no nerves, but still very stupid, is people that say circumcision actually makes it more sensitive and makes sex more pleasurable because then the glans is always exposed, as if the foreskin isn't *more* sensitive than the glans, AND the glans is still exposed due to the gliding motion of the foreskin",1
Not to mention that circumcision makes the glans much less sensitive than it should be because of keratinization.,1
With a lot of nerve endings...,1
And live skin that (in most cases) fully retracts from the glans when erect,1
The only real aesthetic difference it makes is while flaccid,1
I find the whole thing very strange (as an Australian where it’s nowhere near as common as the USA and nobody here cares that much).,1
"Oh, of course not",0
"That's why I think it should stay a modification , I.e",0
something only consenting adults can agree to for themselves,0
Certainly not cutting off a part of penis on baby who can’t give consent.,1
"When it's a choice on the part of the person having it done, it's a modification.",0
"It’s a body mutilation,not modification.",0
That was my husband and my consensus as well,0
"We ended up having a girl, though",0
"In the same vein, we won't get her ears pierced until she can ask for it.",0
And I’m saying there are no benefits,0
Because there aren’t any,0
Americans are just uninformed and happy to bury their heads in the sand,1
It helps them sleep at night telling themselves this rather than thinking “I mutilated my sons genitals”,0
I meant in the aspect of looks/appeal,0
"Generally, I find uncircumcised feels better, but I’m not picky.",1
Circumcision should be illegal unless medically necessary,2
It’s fucking barbaric,2
None of the men in my family have had their genitals mutilated and they’re all fine,1
"I will never understand why anyone would advocate for it, it’s sick.",2
"The foreskin has been found to have up to 20k nerve endings, whereas the clitoris has 8k, so honestly it’s not a bad comparison when you think about it.",1
"That sounds painful for your partner! You made a great decision - if he is still little, just be aware that you should clean his penis like it is a finger, no retracting as it is naturally attached to the head in the way a fingernail is until he is older (sometimes early teen years, or later, which steroid cream could then help with if needed) :)",1
"Read it in a Scottish accent, meself",0
"Try sex ed in a Catholic school for boys in South America, like the one I went to: “don’t have sex unless it’s with the woman you marry and only to have children or you’re going to burn.” I’m unsurprisingly, an atheist now.",2
I mean..,2
"the process of making kids doesn't usually involve x-rays or dissection as far as I know...

Plus when you have six kids it's usually *because* you're not well educated about sex and reproduction!",2
">...became erect limbed...

Heh.",0
I know it's attached to the foreskin (and glans) and at least partially removed by circumcision,2
I was just confused because I could have sworn that I'd read that it was the most sensitive part,1
But then again I'm American and since circumcision is very common sex ed tends to neglect stuff like that,2
...Actually sex ed never taught us any of this stuff because our sex ed sucks,2
"Even when it's ""comprehensive"" it's like ""Sex can get you pregnant",0
Here are some nasty photos of STDs,2
"Good luck lol!"".",1
These men will say they hate feminists and then give the same arguments as the most extreme radical feminists,2
"I mean imagine if this was actually true and men genuinely couldn't help but sexually harass and assault women? In that scenario, wouldn't women be justified in forming female-dominated societies and actively discriminating against men? I mean this guy's opinions about the nature of men is practically identical to the opinions of the ""kill all men"" crowd.",1
"This ""dead flesh just hanging there"" description is bizarre.

It doesn't *hang!* It's like a little flesh turtleneck - quite snug, with just enough play to glide back and forth.

And as for ""dead,"" the foreskin literally has more nerve endings than the glans",2
"I've been with guys who are cut and guys who aren't, and there is a very *noticeable* difference in sensitivity.",0
