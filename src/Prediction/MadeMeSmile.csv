HEY EVERYONE THIS GUY IS RAWDOGN,0
"Okay, then by your logic, the Israeli captives have died all because of the Israeli government torturing and fostering terrorist cells the last 80 fucking years in Palestine",2
Dumbshit logic goes both ways if you press your two atrophied neurons together hard enough.,2
This is all beside the point you just turned a blind eye to everything I wrote,2
Do you want to be a hostage of Hamas? And why was she being held in Refugee Camp?,0
I was so worried for a second with that box üòÖ,0
I think the bit your analysis is missing is the years and years of internationally recognized human rights abuses endured by the Palestinian people,2
"Which doesn't justify Oct 7th, Hamas is not the good guys in the grand scheme of things by any stretch, but if you want to make an honest accounting of the morality of this situation you have to acknowledge that Hamas didn't spring up out of nowhere",1
They are an extremist revolutionary group that achieved power in Gaza as a response to decades of unambiguous apartheid and a population that had nowhere to turn for relief,0
Then they turned around and ended any sort of democracy and started oppressing their own people,1
"Hamas is bad, full stop, but from the perspective of the average Gazan the Israeli government has been worse",2
Especially the current regime,0
"The whole ""we have to take out Hamas no matter the Palestinian civilian casualties"" doctrine would be a lot easier to stomach as a necessary tragedy if members of Bibi's regime hadnt been openly calling for the eradication of the Palestinian people for several years now; if the IDF hadn't responded to mass peaceful humans rights protests by Gazans just a few years ago with overwhelming violence and murder; if illegal under international law settlements weren't continuing to expand in the West Bank with explicit support from the Netanyahu government, kicking innocent Palestinians out of their homes so Israelis can move in a region where Hamas isn't even in charge",1
"Yeah Oct 7th was terrible, I hope all hostages can be free and return to their families like this young woman, but it didn't happen in a vacuum",2
"It happened because we've failed Palestine for nearly a century, we've allowed severe brutality and human rights violations to go unpunished, which led to an extremist group taking power and orchestrating a terrorist attack",2
"Now you are saying we should be ok with even more suffering in Gaza, due to the situation caused by our failure to address the suffering there in the past, which I just can't be on board with.",1
"When you commit so many war crimes that you have the leader of your country wanted on an international level, that's not ""disagree with the methods""",1
Compare what the hostages Gaza has with the hostages Israel has after they're freed,0
"One is still smiling, healthy, and able to return to a normal life while the others look like what you'd see from victims of the concentration camps with walking corpses",1
"What they're doing is awful and you trying to downplay it as ""conducting a war"" proves you to be simple-minded.",2
You seem pretty passionate about condoning collective punishment and blaming an entire ethnic group for the actions of a few people,1

This isn‚Äôt that simple.,0

"much like all of the innocent palestinian children being bombed to death and buried behind rubble.

two things can be true",1
"i'm glad for her and hope her boyfriend avinatan and others like hersh-goldberg polin get rescued.

i feel terrible for jewish families killed during the initial massacre, and also all the *tens of thousands* of faceless (sometimes quite literally), nameless palestinian kids who have been stripped of a future and sent into oblivion.

i wish i could name those people too but they're immediately forgotten",2
Al Jazeera is propaganda,2
They have reported false numbers multiple times in this conflict,2
"Remember when they claimed that Israel bombed one of the hospitals earlier on in the conflict where supposedly 500 people died? Then, it was shown through video evidence that the rocket came from palestine and was shot by hamas",0
"Yet al jeezera claimed it came from Israel and still does.

"It does bring joy to see another in joy, but when you think of all the joy that was ripped away so she could have this joy, it‚Äôs not a happy thing",1
"If you want to see things that bring joy, there are other beautiful things in this world where the benefits of an event vastly outweighs the bad",1
This just isn‚Äôt one of them,0
"Good analysis, just to add; 

A good reporter should also know what the general public would ask",1

Israel chose to save their own over the lives of others,1
"In this regard on all laws, they are within their capacity to save their people",0
"If 200 people were caught in the cross fire, its not on Israel in this case to stop their operation",0
That surely means that the hostages would be killed.,1
