And you also have my respect for pushing so hard and eventually beating it! This is what matters in the end ☺️ thank you! 🤩,2
"Thank you ☺️🐧☺️ we all suffered for those at some point believe me and I personally still suffer on a few of those despite having beaten them (yeah, turbo track 🤣)",2
"Eventually though you will get them all believe me, just keep pushing!",0
"You might be right actually, using drift may be an excuse for doing fewer u-Turns",1
I will try all these runs with speed eventually too because I am curious to see how many seconds you save by using speed :),1
If only I had found this out much sooner would I have not vented to death at my TV for screwing up for hours (350+ attempts) just beating it with drift,1
You have my respect!,0
Update: I finally got it with drift! ✊🏻,0
"With uturn, cutting corners becomes a non-issue",2
It's actually an advantage with speed since it's easier to travel in a straight line while drifting,1
You should try it out with speed anyways to practice u turn corner techniques and improve yourself drastically as a driver,0
Cortex castle is also great for this,1
Getting used to it will make the developer time feel very easy.,1
"You sick beast, You went for Crash cove first!!?? You deserve nothing but respect, I promise aside a few tracks like dragon mines or papu's pyramid nothing will give You many problems",2
Currently making myself miserable by picking up going for dev times again,2
Love to see these!,1
It'd be better suited on a personal youtube channel,1

Fair enough,1
"Ah ouais, bête d'ambiance les infos en arrière-plan",0
Very nice!,1
No,0
Will these ever stop,0
Agreed,0
Its one of a few that were easier for me with drift engine as there are so many tight corners on which its better to build up more reserves by drifting instead of u turning so it lasts longer for sections where its awkward to drift,1
Overall easier to maintain blue fire this way.,0
"True, I agree! Never tried this one with speed, maybe I will out of curiosity to see what time I’ll manage to get",1
The problem with speed despite giving you more speed than drift is that you can’t cut your corners as much as with drift,1
At least for me!,2
Nice,1
It is one of the tracks where drift engine definetly helps.,0

I’ve done the Ring of Fire pro challenge + dev time using drift engine featured in a video posted here days ago,0

"I’ve just beaten Roo’s Tubes, Coco Park, and Papu’s Pyramid",0
"These are all a cakewalk compared to Crash Cove, and I am dreading when I deal with every William P",0
"dev times.
Edit: Tiger Temple could be brutal because I used drift on this one as I did for nearly all of these, and it took me over 4 hours of attempts to beat.",2
That's no fun,2
Wish there were a way to knock this stuff off,0
I am interested!! RaibowPrideAlpa on PSN!!,1
"Yes, and this person shows every so often",0
It’s so bad because you could be winning the race and they only will grieve you if you’re the one that’s winning on the last lap.,1
Honestly I didn't have Turbo Track in my top 10 hardest dev times when I first did it,1
I just didn't find it that difficult,2
I spent a lot more time on so many more tracks compared to this one when I first did it,1
Even when I replayed all the Dev times on PS5 I did it in my first attempt haha.,1
Nice job beating Crash Cove,1
I know a lot of people consider it to be hard so great job,1
Also that is a really excellent time for your first time beating the Dev there,1
So I trust that you will be able to beat them all.,1
"I counted my attempts for each track, and Turbo Track exceeded 1000 attempts (during a 17 hour session jusf for this track) before I finally beat it",0
Doing all tracks in order wasn't a healthy choice.,1
Is this on playstation?,0
And I think he also goes by the name of Thor there’s another_THOR_,0

I’m still struggling with William P on this level how to take a break and this is out looking at other peoples attempts,2
I love/hate Skyway,2
It feels so satisfying to hit those drifts and jumps but I just cant do 3 laps without messing up,1
Why are you calling it 'Retro Stadium'?,0
"Yeah, I only managed to do it because somehow I can do the Z section pretty good (idk why).
But I can not keep the blue fire still so, yeah.",1
🥲,0
"How much time did you spend on beating it? All that time wasn’t wasted on just practicing that one track; you likely improved a good amount in general, meaning the other tracks are going to feel just a bit more natural",1
Also nice on beating that one! I thought that one was relatively difficult compared to most others.,1
"Good job, if you can do crash cove you can do a lot of the others",1
"Just look at it as a way to learn the tracks better and improve, helps take the stress off.",1
You have beaten one of the hardest ones,0
"I’ll caveat that by saying I have four left to beat (Hot Air Skyway, Slide Coliseum, Turbo Track & Drive Thru Danger).

The simplicity of the track means there is nowhere to hide or make up time.",1
"Yeah, uh… the challenge from Turbo Track is to keep up with William and that **DAMN Z SECTION.** And Slide Coliseum is actually really simple",1
By just looking and following (or improving) what William does is enough to beat him.,0
"That’s interesting! For me Turbo Track and Retro Stadium were one of the easiest tracks, but Crash Cove… still have nightmares from it😂",1
You got William's Crash Cove,0
"That one may be the second hardest dev ghost in the game, just beaten by (also) William's Turbo Track",2
"Trust me that the other tracks will feel simpler, specially the CNK tracks",2
"They have some of the easiest dev ghosts in the game.

Very well done, pal!

Note: You don't have to beat William's Retro Stadium to get the Master wheels",2
You can very much skip that one if you want to.,1
You beat one of the hard ones,2

"Thankfully I’ve gotten the hang of it except I despise the dev time where it has to be tight, but being able to drift in the minefield is doable if you proceed through it properly.",2
I managed to figure out these tracks (in terms of how you can properly dev time them with Speed),0
"For Turbo track, you can easily  turn as long as you’re roughly in the median of the road allowing you to not accidentally hit the walls almost every time, and Gingerbread Joyride’s shortcut can allow you to jump off the left side of the beginning of the shortcut immediately after the gate, which could be a hit or miss because you might overshoot it a bit, but it works to nearly stay in the air throughout it.",1

I'm asking which tracks to make and I don't want to decide myself.,0
Fantastic time,1
I hate this track so you won't see me do this lol,2
But I'm glad you are enjoying it,1
Congrats on having a top 100 time.,1
Thanks!,1
Nice run,1
I’d say the twilight tour,0
"Especially when playing other people online, I would get smoked every time",2
Due to not knowing how to use blue fire aka ultra sacred fire or blue turbo,2
I wasn’t able to maintain that blue flame while driving over the green boost pad,2
And while racing ghosts,0
Maybe I am bad at the advanced or technical aspects of this game,2
lol,1
"Spyro Track for far, I only won by first time after 17 attempts, and I'm an advanced player what makes it even worse for me",2
"Drift all the way, better turns and average speed",1
"what you say ""with some more confidence"" is actually one of the best tips, because for me the biggest challenge in this game is not to lose your 5h1t and stay calm! Not sure what engine you use, but if that helps it's possible to beat the developer with drift engine on this one too in case you find speed more challenging",1
"Anything else you may need, let me know! ;) I am sure you'll nail it eventually!",1
"That is so nice, thank you! I’ll try it again with some more confidence 😈",1

Insane! I have such a hard time on this course and you’ve inspired me,2
thank you! ;),0
My heart was pounding in fear that I thought I wouldn’t.,0
Nice work,1
"I see, fair enough!",1
"I'm not that great at the game and u-turning is beyond me, so this just seems like a fiddly track without a really meaningful shortcut",1
The difficulty isn't the factor though I just don't find it enjoyable.,1
cut your corners as much as possible and on the big shortcut when you jump u-turn slightly towards the right direction,1
"It's not an easy track by any means, but there are much harder than this IMHO.",2
Strongly dislike this track.,1
"It depends on the track, I still use Speed on more than half",1
But I still use Drift on a good number of tracks,1
There are tracks that I used Speed to get better times in time trials,1
But for those same tracks in an online race I would still probably use Drift.,0
That is still not a question,0
"If you watch till the end and get to see my times on this track, you’ll see that I had an 01:30:32 and that was the time I had initially beaten the developer with and it was with drift",0
"Then, I got a 01:30:25 also with drift but oh dear not only I had to cut the corners, but make out with them",1
Pure pain if you do this track with drift and without the big boy grass cut,1
"With speed which is the run I’ve posted here I got an 01:30:08 pretty easily and smoothly (so definitely room for improvement), therefore probably for this one I would recommend speed engine (as much as I hate this engine), especially if you’re not planning to go for the big boy grass shortcut.",1

It has to do with your router,0

No idea how to change it though.,0
"While not Nitro Fueled, rumor has it that OG CTR has some news coming from it.",0
"Some tracks that I CANNOT stand are…
* Out of Time due to its invisible walls that tell you ""FCK your fire!”.
* Koala Carnival as it's just a boring oval and there's no way to catch up once you get behind.
* Turbo Track bc of my trauma with William's ghost and how the pads give you little to no reserves at all.
* Nina's Nightmare, same issue with pads.
* Dingo Canyon, since its turns are so uncomfortable to drive along",2
They just feel… bad.,2

still exceptional either way! thanks for the interaction,1
"PS definitely has more players, thus it would probably be lower, I’m thinking maybe top 300 there? I’m not sure.",1
very good stuff! does Xbox have fewer players vs PS4 hence the 86th position or would it be similar on PS4 you reckon?,1
Wtf is this poll asking,2

Crash Cove
Dingo Canyon

I’m not a huge fan of Out Of Time either, but to be fair it’s a skill issue I have trying to keep blue fire on this track, and the amount of time it took me to beat William P has caused some resentment.",1

"4) Tiny Arena (many say it’s the one of the easiest to beat the dev, it’s too long and things can go wrong in so many different places!)",1
"It’s not a hard one, but boring and hard to not lose fire at any time within 03:08:00 minutes",2

If you refer to the fence shortcut do a little hop on the ground before jumping the fence,1
I hate this track,2
"Stupid pumpkins, stupid green slime, stupid shortcut I can't do properly.",2
"Speed, there's no reason to drive any other since u-turn eliminates the disadvantage of poor steering",2
"The only track that I really don't like to drive is Turbo Track, the layout is really simple, I'm not a fan of going off track through the grass and that infamous S section where you have to rapidly u-turn in the ground multiple times.

Then there's the tracks that I like doing time trials on, but I hate playing online.

Prehistoric Playground with that initial blue fire chokepoint where everyone has powers",2
"The track is literally a coin toss, if you get hit there you already lost, and if you miraculously don't then it's a time trial simulation since you are probably the only player that didn't get hit lol.

Gingerbread Joyride with that tight shortcut after the only blue fire pad in the whole track, everyone just fills it with countless nitros and potions in there.

Overall, I don't particularly like any track with blue fire for multiplayer",1
"When a race is close, it all comes down to whoever gets hit first and the race is over (since the sources of blue fire are limited to specific pads in the track, and even then there's usually only one pad that gives you the fastest one)",2

Also turbo track and by extension, retro stadium.",0
"Also, the shortcut that the developer takes on lap 2 and 3 after the starting line isnt necessary and it’s actually not that fast (so don’t bother learning it)",1
There are more optimal ways to do that,1
"The ideal one (and if done right) is to build enough reserves before and once you get there after the starting line, you start jumping and hopping through the grass and then you start drifting immediately after once you get to boost pad aiming for perfect boosts",1
"Also when you hop in the grass, as you land from jumping, you should try getting a boost as you land because the challenge with this is not to lose the reserves especially on lap 2, lap 3 can be more forgiving as you’ve built enough reserves",1
On Lap 2 I did this better than the lap 3 and that’s way my lap 2 was faster.,1
"Tip for the fence shortcut: hop once first, then jump",1
"As you arrive there and after you’re done with your boosts, make a small hop on the ground (not the grass ideally) before the fence, and then jump.",1
Jesus christ that ending was close thought you lost it haha nice driving!,1

Seems like I do, but it seems like you don't considering you shit unjustified towards subsidiary studios just because their Crash games were produced by Activision, specially NF that got free Bonus content that would've fit in the DLC category, knowing today's Activision standards.

I think your hatred towards Crash comes off Activision, being the owner and producer of new Crash games",1

Keep in mind that Activision doesn't have full control over the developing games,1

* I prefer CNK over CTR because almost all chars are viable, it's amazing ost, it's intimidating villain, it's more ""regulated"" reserves system that make items an actual option and I do enjoy every single track in CNK whereas CTR has some of my least fav tracks that I still cannot stand in NF.",1

I don't know if maybe it has to do with the platform I play on,0
I've also seen glitches in the ranking system,0
"(The famous rank 0), so that could be a possibility.",1
Drifting (and learning to maintain boosts from pads) is the best part,1
So if you're already having fun you're in for a good time once you get it down.,1

Oxide turns easy when you learn the turbo boost pattern and gain a little bit of u turn knowledge,1

I know that was top 600 at the time.,1
I asked if it had been patched to be harder at some point,2
Not whether it was hard or not.,2
"No, once you get the learning curve",0
Velo and dev times are another thing tho,0
"As far as I'm aware, Hard difficulty was toned down at some point during a patch update",1

There’re 4 stages of time-trials,0
"The first is N Tropy the easiest one (need to know how to keep reserves mainly), then Oxide (need to keep reserves a bit longer and take the basic shortcuts, then Velo (need to keep reserves for 3/4 of the track or more and take the shortcuts) and the final time trial challenge once you’ve beaten the above 3 is the developers (not just one developer, there are 5-6 different developers time trialling if I remember correctly) time trials which will give you the master wheels if you beat them all (need to keep reserves for the entire track, take like 99% of the shortcuts, cut corners to the best of your ability and ideally use the quickest engines: drift and speed)",1

"> CTR lets you customize for looks without compromising stats 

I love that about this game as well.",2
"While driving, press R1 (or L1 if you are left-handed) and right or left on the joystick (depending on the direction you want to go) to start a power slide, the bar at the bottom right corner of the screen will begin to fill, when it turns red press the opposite shoulder bottom to boost, you can boost up to 3 times in a single powerslide

In the remake, your wheels glow as an additional visual cue of when to press L1",1
"You can activate that function in the options menu

Then there is the reserves system, reserves are a number hidden from players that decreases every second, think of it as your fuel, You won't stop moving if it runs out, but you will lose speed, You can accumulate reserves by boosting, using turbo pads and the turbo item

If you build reserves your turbos will last longer and you will be able to chain them with the speed that the turbo pads give you because in CTR there is no speed system like in Mario kart (150 cc, 200 cc, etc.) the turbo pads on each track give you different speeds, the main classification on said speeds is:

-Yellow fire
-Sacred fire
-Ultimate sacred fire

The later can't be chained in the original, You loose your speed if You boost but not your reserves, i'm the remake the ultimate sacred fire was renamed as blue fire and can be chained with regular boosts and if You have the skills, mantain it for the whole race

Hope this helps, good luck",1

Wow I'm glad you mentioned that this game actually has much more content than Mario Kart,1
"I'm getting bombed whenever I make this statement in Nintendo subs.

"Once you start drifting, a meter on the bottom right corner will fill up",1
"Once it goes red, press the R1 or L1 depending on which one you are holding down",2
"Do it 3 times I a row to successfully perform a drift boost.








Why does the game tell you that in world 2? Should’ve been one of the very first things the game  explains you.",1
No problem,0
Takes a bit to get used to but the speed you can get in this game is INSANE,2
It's so much fun and gives you a lot of control over your kart,1
The brake system is fun too because if you brake in midair during a jump and turn before you land your kart does this insanely sharp turns that make it so that you can turn on a dime,2
Super fun game.,2
Thanks a million,1
Really appreciate the help.,1
"So theres two drift buttons.
Hold one to initiate",0
"Once you're drifting the bar in the corner will start going up, hit the other drift button right before it hits the end and youll get a boost but DONT let go of the first drift button that you're holding",1
The bar will go back to the beginning and you can boost again,0
You can do this 3 times to get 3 boosts before you must let go of the drift.,0
"Drift engine is definitely my preference too, yeah",0
For me it’s choosing either full speed (speed) or quick enough but easier to keep reserves and cut corners (drift),1
That’s at least the way I see it !,2
"Nice, i as well beat 3/4 of my Dev times using Drift as it's my main playing on the Switch Lite.",1
"Yeah I remember this one being a hard time to beat, for sure.",1
Thank you! With acceleration it’s possible but it’s a pain,0
With turn I highly doubt it,1
To be fair I could do better in this run and get a better time with drift but as you can see I was a bit slower on the second lap as I didn’t cut the corners as much as I did on the third lap,1
IMO Matthew had a good run here so for me it’s def not one of the easiest Dev times,1

"When you build your reserves make sure you see ""perfect"" and not just ""good""",1
"Also, if you use speed to beat it, don't",0
Use drift and the flames will be gone much harder than when using speed,2
"Once you've built your reserves by doing perfect boosts, when you get to the S section you will have to play doing a combination of hopping and u-turning",1
"I haven't posted a video on tiny arena yet, but if you want check my IG account where I post reels with my runs and I mention below the videos if I used speed or drift.",0
How did you pass S section on map in tiny arena? I always lose speed there.,0

lol I’ll be sure to upload Turbo Track next to be consistent 😆,1
I notice you have Tiny Temple too on your channel,0
The first video I put on my channel was Tiny Temple then Crash Cove lol,1
It's funny we share those same 2 tracks first,1
But hey I hope you reach your goal of under 1:19.,0
"Awesome, thanks for the tip and video",1
I’m never confident I have enough reserves lol,1
"Hey good job beating the Dev, I have a video of getting under 1:19",1
I would say a big thing near the end is trying not to really go on the boost pads again,1
I did on the 2nd lap  but it is not necessary,0
The only boost pad you really need to touch is the first one in the track and that's it,1
That will help shave off time,0
"You really want to be close to the walls during that section at the end.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsjiY4VfewQ",1
Tebrik ederim.,0
Yeah totally doing those time trials helped to improve the skill level a lot,1
"If it wasn’t for it, probably my level would’ve been as good as Velo’s",1
"And I agree, managing to finish quicker than the dev with drift or anything else other than speed depends on how well you can u-turn and cut corners so yeah skill level again",2
"It’s all very personal Anw when it comes to these time trials, everyone has a different experience",1
"My “weird” cases are coco park and ….tiny arena… yes you heard right Tiny arena being quite hard to achieve a good time in, and that crash cove was way easier for me than others",1
For instance if someone asks me to beat the dev playing crash cove and coco park it would probably take me 1 or 2 attempts to beat crash cove and probably 10-20 to beat coco!,0
"I don't remember all of it, its been 2 at least since I finished it but I think crash cove was the hardest one for me purely from a time perspective, it was also my first so idk how I would do after doing all the rest.

Most of those I found hard were more skill issues like u-turning corners properly, in crash cove I felt more capped by the speed itself, if that makes sense ? Can't describe it better",1
Doing the TTs really levels up my skill back then though,1
"Congrats on doing all with drift, however I would def not call drift comfortable on tracks like Koala Carnival!! 😅",1
I beat dev last night,0
"Drift is definitely possible, since I did all on drift.

Technically Accel is also possible, but I think for crash cove it's like 2/10th of a second slower than Accel WR",0
"At least it used to be idk now.

Accel is definitely pushing it to the limit but drift is ""comfortably""on all",1
Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 is actually a pretty big improvement over the first one,1
"I recently played it and got the Platinum, but I still have some challenges to do and a few secret vehicles to collect",2
"The drifting system is really fun and rewarding, the car customisation is great both in a practical sense (changing car perks/stats) and aesthetically (user made livery system with hundreds of paintjob designs for each car), around 160-170 vehicles from 6 different classes), and the game modes are a lot of fun",1
There is also a pretty active online community and it never takes longer than a few seconds to find a match,2
"On top of that, the track builder/share is probably the best I've seen in any racing game which really adds to the already pretty large selection of tracks and environments",1
The game opens up even more when you realise that you can build cars to fly over large distances using the boost in order to perform skips on certain tracks/waypoint missions,1
Some speed runners have finished entire waypoint missions without their car ever touching the ground.,0
Haha same,1
I actually just jumped on today and beat another dev time and called it a day.,0
I used drift as well for a lot of them,1
I only have like half of them beat but I stopped a while ago because I was just getting annoyed and my hands were hurting 😂 I know I can beat them but because the game died I lost motivation to continue,2
This gives me hope,0
I hate trying to keep blue flame with speed.,2
"That is cool you mostly used Drift, they are all definitely possible with Drift, but I still used Speed for like half the tracks when I first beat the Dev times back in 2020",1
But yeah Drift is very helpful on certain tracks and I still will only use Drift on certain tracks down to this day.,1
let me know if you want me to leave comments on the tracks/spots that developers mess a bit per track so that you know where you can capitalize on.,2
Roo’s Tubes is my comfort track,0
"It was my favorite track to grind for Wumpa Coins, since it was short and could therefore get the Golden Wumpa to spawn more often.

I played it so much, I can even play the entire thing in my head.",1
you don't need the big boy shortcut to beat the dev on polar pass,0
I beat him using drift engine without the big shortcut on any lap,0
My time was 02:09:13 vs 02:09:99,0
"Hello, use whatever you feel comfortable with",1
I personally used Drift on this track and got under 3mins,0
"I know the Dev time is a little over 3:09 here so it isn't to bad as long as you keep your fire for most of the track.

The vehicle should only face the direction you are drifting",2
So I'm not to sure,1
But as long as it doesn't affect your gameplay it should be fine.,1
I will start tiny arena tonight,0
Speed or drift is better for that map ? While doing drift boost I jump and look other direction for turn and sometime The vehicle changes direction without jumping,1
Is this normal or animation bug ?,1

This is not useful for Ring Rally,2
"Every ring skipped is fewer points and less time to get more.

For Time Trials; you take a wider line, and get stuck on the wall for a while, so it's a lot slower than the regular cut",1
"However, the other block has the same wall ride collision",2
"If you jump into the very side, you get flung up without getting stuck, and it's a bit faster (\~0.2 s) because it's a better racing line in the air.

I have the top time on the Switch leaderboards, here is the shortcut in action: [https://youtu.be/4n\_VbqbJmsM?t=1067](https://youtu.be/4n_VbqbJmsM?t=1067)",1

"**ABSOLUTELY!!**

• You can start to learn the basic of CTR through Adventure and win some cash in the process.

• You can play a Single Race if you're not in the mood to grind.

• You can play a Battle if you want to have fun and practice your shots.

• Time Trial and it's ghosts are always there to take a challenge and improve massively at the game and look for a personal best squeezing your 101%.

• You have the classic CTR and Crystal challenges too",1
"Everything stays in the same spots as their original counterparts (excepting Hyper Spaceway).

• And Ring Rally remains here too to fully master your U-Turn skills and win more cash as you complete more and more laps.

• Each time you complete any event (race, battle, cups, challenges…) you get Wumpa coins that you can spend in the in-game shop for swag items like new kart sets, paint jobs, characters, skins, wheels with unique trails, stickers, etc.",1

All I would say is that it takes practice and you will eventually get the feel of it,0
I could show you a video of mine but I don't think it would really help,1
It just more comes down to having the right feel,1
But honestly if you are fast enough you don't have to use the big shortcut to beat the Dev there,1
You can use the other shortcut,2
When I first beat the Dev there I didn't know how to U Turn and didn't use the big shortcut but the other one,1

My tip is simply to drift boost so much that driving straight feels wrong.,2
Coco park in time trial mode and go backwards,0
"Aside from the annoying message telling you that you’re going the wrong way, you’ll go infinite on the widest track in the game

After half an hour of that, you’ll be better already

Practice one aspect of drift boosting at a time (doing it in the straightest line possible, seemlessly ending and starting a new drift, the timing to get perfect boosts, etc)

Then to git good, time trials are the best method",1
"After some time in coco park, you should be able to destroy Ntropy",1
"Once you’ve beaten Oxide everywhere you’ll have a good understanding of the basics, which you’ll then improve on in your fights against Velo",1
"After that, you’ll be able to compete online and start tackling the dev time trials",1
That's a really good idea,1
"The rings will automatically give you the boost to go really fast, so even if you do it you can get back up to speed quickly and try again",1
Wait - air u-turning is so much simpler as there’s zero risk of losing your fire,0
What exactly is tripping you up about it?,1
Coco Park,0
The first couple tracks are pretty easy to learn them on,1
Nsanity Beach for instance not a bad track to just repeat and learn the ropes.,2
"Cortex castle is a good one since it also features sharp turns to get the hang of things imo, but for learning id say coco park if your not very skilled because its baby easy",1
"I’d recommend using one of the wide open battle arenas (like Desert Storm, Skull Rock, Rampage Ruins, etc.)",2
I used Desert Storm when I was practicing u-turns and it helped a lot.,0
"To learn your Power Sliding, pick the most simple tracks",1
"Those that don't include sharp turns nor Blue Fire, as you're not prepared for them yet",2
"Those being:
* Crash Cove
* Roo's Tubes
* Slide Coliseum
* Coco Park
* Inferno Island
* Jungle Boogie
* Meteor Gorge
* Assembly Lane (without shortcuts)

And my absolute favorite…
* Android Alley

You'll know that you've already mastered the very basics of Power Sliding if you can keep alive your fire during at least a single lap.",1
hot air skyway is pretty nice if you ask me,1
"Since you have the risk of falling off, it really trains the accuracy of your race lines",1
"arguably, one of the nastiest shortcut in CTR",0
"imagine, you need to perfect the shortcut in 3 lapses",1
"the sleepless nights when i tried to beat this map.

[3yrs ago, never looked back",0
](https://youtu.be/tzeRmsvQjq4?si=XYbszggmSKRJk6bs),0
"Coco Park, I think it's the widest track of all and it's a turn left x4 track, pretty easy to drive.

You can also learn chain multiple slide sequences and accumulate boost reserves",1
Sewer Speedway is pretty good,1
To me it flows really well and its just a fun track to practise on.,1
"Try ring rally, that’ll almost force you to learn the drift boost and it’ll teach you the best lines to take alongside the shortcuts",1
"Start with a wide track like Coco Park or Roo’s Tubes.

Once you feel more comfortable move on to the time trials so you haven’t got the items to worry about and give the ghosts a try.",1
Coco park and slide coliseum are the best to learn in.,1
All of them,0
Part of being good at the game is knowing the tracks really well and knowing where to start your turns,1
"But if I had to say one track for a non-advanced player to practice drift boosting, maybe Coco Park? Its a very wide track so its very forgiving if you drift too wide or too sharp",1
I doubt it is bugging out,0
First before you can race against the N.Tropy ghost you have to get a time that is at least close to him,2
You will always have a ghost of your best time even if you haven't unlocked the chance to face him,1
But if you have unlocked the chance to face him then you need to make sure that you select him so you can play against his ghost,1
If you beat his time but don't play against his ghost then you won't get a star next to that track,0
"That goes the same thing for Oxide, Velo and the Devs",0
You have to play against them to beat their time and then you will get a star letting you know it's complete,1
"But you can only unlock each of the ghosts after you beat every single one then in order which goes from N.Tropy, Oxide, Velo and the Devs.",2
"That's some bullshit, I feel for you",0
"Yes, all rings are valuable",0
This would be helpful for the pro challenges that restart once a month,0
"Right now, we have a challenge to do 12 laps of ring rally on papu's pyramid",1
This (if beneficial) could help cut time on later laps that don't give anything more than 5 milliseconds (lap 8+),1
"I personally have done this challenge, but I can never do it swiftly on the first try",1
It always takes me 15 or so minutes to do it,0
I'm always looking to improve my own tactics.,1
"Cool discovery! I haven't watched all that many ring rally WRs, are there any where people actually skip rings to take shortcuts? My assumption is that the time and points gained from hitting every ring is always more valuable",1
solid meme,0
3:24 I believe iirc,0
"As far as I remember, Oxide is barely faster on this track",1
Can you confirm?,0
You have the right setup its just practice,1
"Holding L2 (dpad down) is super important for the uturn, if you go a break turn even a second early without L2 itll kill your reserves

It feels like a hand cramp to do it right but youll get it with practice, maybe try other levels and ring challenge to get used to the uturns, but you definitely have the right setup just more practice!",1
Ok,1
"I mean, technically speaking, obtaining the master wheels made me much faster and I'd encourage anyone looking to get better at the game to do the grind",2
"But that's obviously due to the practice/training involved in unlocking them, not due to the item itself.",2
"Man I do but that Person could read your comment and say ""Do I really have to farm those wheels to be faster?!"" 😭",1
..,0
I forget that people on the Internet don't have a sense of humor.,0
Also soo confused by the oxide time thing and the ghosts like the setup for all that is confusing for me! Like I have the lil ghost of my character on most those maps but zero stars on all! 🤔 I’ve been told it could be bugging on my end but yeah that sucks if so cause I’ll most likely have to scrap that load and start anew 😫,2
this being nothing scares me LOL,1
Just finished getting the beenox crates and that felt like an accomplishment 😅 I just started online recently had the game downloaded for over a year and never thought to play online! Still only about 30 percent on adventure mode cause I can’t figure out what I need to do next to unlock another area or whatever 😂 I need to look up some vids for guidance no doubt haha!,2
the dev times got nerfed,0
"apparently they were supposed to be few seconds faster every track but then they decided to make it easier that kind of ruined the ""racing against devs"" idea",1
Same,0
I played online to unlock the champion cart and wheels when the game was active and then I never touched online again lol,2
Single player is where it’s at,2
So much to do and it’s fun,1
I change my button setting down pad switch to L2 button,2
İt is easy ground uturn but jump need more practice,1
I think i try make jump and u turn same time maybe this is problem?,0
Thanks,1
"U-turning is hard with the analog, so if you're using it, I suggest going to the arrow keys (dpad)",2
It makes the mechanic of u-turning less busy and feeling less clunky,2
"(Down on the dpad, and whatever direction you're going to go L/R) 

To give yourself a constant timer for your seals, you can turn map intros off, and they'll be in the same place at the exact times, every race",1
"The jump is best hit using reserves and not slide into from a powerslide, and using the center/right side of the ramp to make the u-turn over",1
"Try to get a perfect U, and not a sharp U, because the wall is kinda touchy, and sometimes likes to smack you in the water",1
"Sometimes driving styles can help, swap up between drift and speed, and get acclimated with them both (you'll need both) and see what works for you",0
I used drift to beat this map,0
"I don't know anything about play-share, but if you need visual help, I can post a video of the shortcut being executed, as I play on switch.",0
No?,0
"Good job, we all have to start at the beginning first with beating N",1
Tropy so nice job,1
I look forward to your continuing progress as you get better.,1
It's so good.,1
"Once you play CTR, Mario Kart will feel too bland.",0
God yes.,0
Man remember that this game Was Created for Single player back in the days ! So the experience is great the difficulty is ok and has some spikes in some boss fights that can be challenging.,1
Yup,0
"I enjoyed the multiplayer, but it’s not why this fans is my 2nd favourite game ever.",2
"You're just getting started, brother",0
Good job on beating N Tropy though! Each round of trials is challenging and teaches you more about the depth of the game,1
They're all doable with practice and patience,0
Remember to take breaks or you'll throw your controller,0
"Eventually, these N",0
Tropy times will seem like nothing.,0
"No, man",0
You're right,1
No hate to the OP,2
"Good job, OP, but you're just getting started! Good luck and have fun beating the next few rounds of time trials!",1
Nice job! A win is a win.,1
Absolutely,1
The story mode is really fun but nothing complicated and there are tons of time trials.,2
The good news is that they're just cosmetics,1
It's at least good that it doesn't affect gameplay mechanics..,1
Aside from the fact that spiro with the master wheels is objectively faster /s,1
A LOOOT of cosmetics to grind,0
Theres quite a few modes too,2
Ring rally is new in nitro fueled,1
"Adventure mode is pretty fun with a lot of back tracking if you want to complete it 100% (or like 101% or whatever the percentage is lol)

Time trials has a lot of replay value too",1
"The ai is really brutal for beginners, but no match for someone who mastered the mechanics and shortcuts.

And just a sidenote, the music is awesome :D",1
"There are 4 tiers of time trials, N.Tropy - Oxide - Velo - Developer, each harder than the last",2
If you put your mind to it you can get it done but it will take a very long time.,2
"Kind of depends on what you want out of it

If it’s just strictly you playing by yourself, no online, no one sitting next to you, then it’s still a fun game.

There’s a handful of race types and several tracks and cup races.

Then there’s the actual single player game where you race against the bad guys",2
"It’s fun, but not ground breaking or anything.

For me, it’s a game I can have fun on my own, but also both my kids like it and will race against each other and me",1
That’s my favorite part.,1
"Yup, exactly how I felt

I think the downvotes are either from people who can’t beat the devs or actual homophobes 😅🤣",1
I play solely single player,2
"Its relaxing, it zens me out after a long day at work, and is a great game to unwind with.
The game does a great job of rewarding you for getting better",1
"I would recommend it, at least.",2
Not really,2
The single player stuff is tedious,2
"Wait, you get velo by besting oxide, right? Guess I still have a lot to learn",1
"I won't do any posts until I get good enough times on advanced courses after this, someday maybe someday",1
I just wanted to get N.Trophy to complete my roster.,1
probly going to get downvoted into oblivion but fuck it..,2
this is nuthin m8! get back to us when you're at least on velo trials lmao,1
"Yeah, I didn't really feel like I had a real victory on that track because of that",1
If he hadn't thrown the race I wouldn't have gotten it.,0
"The main downside to single player is you don't get nearly as many coins as you would online, making unlocking a lot of the cosmetic stuff really slow.",1
"I play almost exclusively in single player, even back when the game was active",2
It's great,1
Even the hard difficulty cpus are challenging.,1
Was just gonna say those 2 that you mentioned were literally the last 2 i needed to complete before i got my wheels,1
I never got any practice done on the railwagon shortcut so that i had to perfect before beating him,1
Slide was my last as i had to master the art of perfect jumping between the tires as well as the grass shortcuts,1
Good memories tho! 😂,1
Yeah! There’s two sides to it I guess,0
People who needed that fumble at the last moment (me) vs people who felt a bit cheated,0
I feel like slide colosseum is more annoying,2
"What about you, what track gave you trouble? For me it was dragon mines.

I feel like I have it easier because I played this game since Christmas Day 1999, so it expedited my progress, but it’s still difficult enough

Ps",2
lol who are those downvotes from? Homophobes? 😂,1
"Turbo Track was'nt all that difficult tbh so i feel you, if the Dev did'nt mess up at the end it might have been a problem for most people.",2
There is a ton of things to do in single player,2
Adventure mode for starters and then when you become a true degen you start grinding time trials,1
"I think I did everything in adventure mode but I always got 100% for doing everything except all gold relics even after doing everything in the game.

I should fix that just, I'm not good at crate and driving at the same time...",2
😅,0
I had such a great time doing these back around the time the game came out,1
Did all of the platinum relic races too,0
"Tried getting back into the game when dev times came out but I think the muscle memory was just too degraded by that point, I wasn’t nearly as good and it was frustrating enough that I didn’t feel like continuing",2
Maybe one day,0
"Ah ye, wait a tick.",0
i mean't for the newer version of the game..,2
ignore me :-),0
"Drift boost like, all the time",0
And generally just master the tracks i guess,1
Time trials can help you find faster lines/shortcuts,0
Theres also this hidden tech called uturning which is really good.,1
Shortcuts and sacred fire,0
Is it normal to have some minor flickering black textures on the left and right sides when using widescreen?,2
"You mean online co-op splitscreen?

Well, before that we have to implement online in the first place.",2
"If anyone could mod it, where 2 people could play online together, from the same console..",1
that would be great,1
ps - great work with this mod btw :-),1
thank you,0
what you did here will go down in crash bandicoot history.,2
Incredible.,1
You’re going to love playing against Oxide…,1
"I’d be down for a race, but I’m in Australia, so I would be lagging quite a bit if you’re American",2
Oh you poor soul…,2
Cool!,1
the goat Polar,0
"Trying to sabotage crash’s cart, typical Oxide being a cheater",2
"Great work, keep it up 👍",1
"Except when you're ahead in 1st place and all you get are beakers and nitro crates when a warp orb comes to hit you, or missiles that dodge those to hit you, or still manage to hit you after a jump but your missiles hit a wall when the AI makes a little hop.....",2
"From Dr, N",0
"Tropy to William P.

A long way to go mate! Keep it up!",2
"""You thrashed me, mate",0
"No worries, but you'll soon be up against much worse.""",2
Both nitro point and winning online races would work,1
There was a Nitro Points leaderboard and a Online Racing leaderboard and getting 5% in either of them would net you the Champion kart with Decal.,1
Oh so it was Nitro Points that determined the leaderboard scores? That makes sense,1
"I did grind a lot back then.

I guess I misremembered how it worked, so unlocking that Kart body wasn't a glitch after all.",0
Congratulations! I remember how amazing it felt to finally beat his time on that track.,1
"You didnt have to be good at races, getting top 5% on the Nitro points leaderboard (the stuff that you used to unlock stuff)",1
And for most seasons the final unlockable on that was more rare than the Champuon Kart decal for that season and iirc Season 1 my friend got it like 2 unlockables into Gold  tier,1
I guess that’s how it’s done now,0
During Grand Prix mode people had to get into the top 5% of the leaderboard by the end of a monthly season.,1
Maybe that’s how it happened,0
I remember a pop up telling me about a Back N,0
"Time decal being given to me, followed shortly by another message saying I now have the Champion Kart body unlocked.

There’s no way I unlocked it properly, though",0
"I’m bad at online races because I can’t maintain the fire, so most of the time I’m way behind everyone else",2
The only times I’ve ever won an online race was when my controller ran out of power,0
"After switching to another one, the other racers were replaced with AI drivers that kept driving into walls lol.",1
You did it very well bud,1
"In time, you’ll find overall tracks easier",0
Congratulations!,0
Maybe I need to get a better time than this? But if that’s the case I really wish they’d include the time required to receive the stars 😭,1
[http://192.168.0.1/index.html](http://192.168.0.1/index.html),0
Must be a bug if you did the track and did beat the ghost,0
My Trophy and oxide times have stars so it must be a bug,0
I can’t get any stars on my tracks even though I beat the ghost ? is there something I’m missing 😭 and there’s so many tracks to complete I really want to unlock the Champion Kart but I don’t see that happening any time soon for me 😩,1
"As far as I remember, N Tropy is super close to Oxide time on Oxide station",1
Like 3 seconds off or something,0
It has to be one of the hardest N Tropy times if I remember correctly.,0
"Although I do agree that Drive-Thru Danger is cruel for casuals and inexperienced players (took me near an hour to get my first flawless lap), the shortcuts are actually quite easy",2
All but one of them are possible with Sacred Fire.,0
That depends on if you intend to challenge the dev times.,0
I feel like I'm missing something cuz I can't get N.trophy to show up,2
"I thought he'd be easy since this track is crash heavy, but I guess not.",1
"Drive Through Danger, that place is unforgiving to casuals",0
"Fun fact, that was actually the first one I beat which got me into the time trials! But yeah, congratulations my guy 👌",1
"I know there's harder stuff, let me have this W pls.
Currently suffering at oxide station",2
Who gonna tell 'em?,0
"I thought the champion kart was unlocked by beating time trials, or am I misremembering that?",0
Out of Time's Velo ghost is the definition of pain,0
oh my sweet summer child.,1
![gif](giphy|IjJ8FVe4HVk66yvlV2|downsized),0
So the Back N,0
Time decal was glitched and given to everyone (I believe it is still given to people rn too if they get the Champion kart from the Oxide trials),0
Idk about the other stuff but like the 5% threshold on S1 nitro gauge was pretty low like it wasnt even halfway through Gold tier was top 5%.,1
Keep it up!! It's only becoming harder,1
Great and this is just the beginning :-),1
Sorry to hear that,2
