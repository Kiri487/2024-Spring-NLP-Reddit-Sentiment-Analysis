Have fun getting out lol,1
This is the oddest comment because you come across no different and in fact exactly the same as the dumb shits you reference.,1
"I knew you were referring to ancient Greeks, but you didn't first mention it, and I just started imagining this Greek mathematician in the 80's figuring out the earth was round",1
"""He did some math.""",0
"I mean, what the mods posted was the real version of this photo (the same photo without the filter),

Political context aside; this is rightfully a historic photo,0
"The man used his pen and folded millions on top on millions; what can you say about his upbringing, when he did what he was supposed to do in the end and that was make money and create a sustainable life for the American people? Again I mean this outside the realm of politics",1
He looked the american people in the face and told us we were being throwing our tax dollars away and this is what I believe as a Canadian is what influenced the level of preparedness that we DID have to answer to a gllobal pandemic,0
"Could we have executed operation lightspeed without the ground work he layed out from Korea to Russia? We really had those years, not any other generation before",1
That wasn't political; that was Donald Trump doing the job he was being requested of at birth and something about it is obviously going to be left for observation in history books whether or not you want to argue over top of your voter card.,1

Secondary edit, had she served it I would have personally reported it.",1

"If you wanted to risk the cross contamination for yourself technically you could buy the separate ingredients and then saran wrap them in such a way,  though i assume you wouldn't.

People are strange",1
"I come from about 15 years cooking background and maybe 11 years into it I'm a sous chef and I catch the ""head waitress"" (in this case an actually fictional position as I also helped with payroll issues for BOH staff and knew she was just a waitstaff, no promotion above normal position) as she's setting up a platter of raw fish to make 'sushi.' This of course I stopped immediately under the pretext that ""No one prepares food in my kitchen without permission with intent to serve it, especially raw protein ingredients on the waitstaff station"" knowing that she would have no grounds to disagree, this also generally being true as she wasn't on payroll as kitchen staff or ServSafe etc",1
"Predicting the later argument, I called my local OSHA/ServSafe contact for advice and he happened to be free and more local than usual on another inspection, and would stop by for a chat",1
"I then approached the GM, who also owned the place, and is a narcissistic actor and thus fairly easy to manipulate if needed when his character is potentially being questioned",1
"He jad a shitfit over it and barely stopped chewing the waitstaff out before the OSHA rep arrived and casually explained with a grin that if she had 'served' any 'sushi,' the license could have been suspended or removed, and then doubled down on something I had yelled at her earlier, saying that it wasn't even sushi since she wasn't a licensed sushi chef and that the repercussions of that would have fallen solely on her since she was clocked in as wait staff",2

"Man, I don't know enough about the basic biology on either side to answer that question",0
"I'll answer anyway.

The huntsman spider WOULD not",0
"Spiders are notoriously defensive, and most fatal spider bites are because we manage to intrude on their space",1
The leading suspicion when it comes to Huntsmen aggression is that there's been a transgression against their nest,0
Would not,0
"But COULD?

"In my brain, however, there's a stupid asshole spinnipede just all a casual bop bop bopping along when all a sudden a huntsman spider blinks out of nowhere and shreds it.",2
"Let's break down the analysis for accuracy regarding the statements about the 1924 Democratic National Convention, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the alleged ""party switch.""

### 1924 Democratic National Convention (DNC) and the ""Klanbake""
- **Claim:** The 1924 DNC, held at Madison Square Garden in New York City, was called the ‚ÄúKlanbake‚Äù and featured a full-on KKK parade.
- **Accuracy:** The 1924 DNC is indeed known historically as the ‚ÄúKlanbake.‚Äù This term refers to the strong presence and influence of the Ku Klux Klan at the convention, where the Klan was a significant political force within the Democratic Party, particularly among Southern Democrats",1
"The convention was marked by intense debates over a resolution condemning the KKK, which was ultimately defeated, reflecting the Klan's influence",1
"However, describing it as a ""full-on KKK parade"" might be an exaggeration; the term ""Klanbake"" was more about the political influence and support rather than an actual parade at the event.
- **Conclusion:** Mostly accurate but somewhat hyperbolic in describing the nature of the Klan‚Äôs presence.

### Civil Rights Act of 1964 Voting Breakdown
- **Claim:** The breakdown of the votes for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 shows significant differences within and between the political parties.
- **House of Representatives Voting Data:**
  - **For the Act:** 290 votes (Democratic: 152, Republican: 138)
  - **Against the Act:** 130 votes (Democratic: 96, Republican: 34)
  - **Percentage Breakdown:**
    - **Democratic Party:** 61% in favor, 39% against
    - **Republican Party:** 80% in favor, 20% against
- **Senate Voting Data:**
  - **For the Act:** 73 votes (Democratic: 46, Republican: 27)
  - **Against the Act:** 27 votes (Democratic: 21, Republican: 6)
  - **Percentage Breakdown:**
    - **Democratic Party:** 69% in favor, 31% against
    - **Republican Party:** 82% in favor, 18% against
- **Accuracy:** These figures are accurate and reflect the historical voting record for the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
- **Conclusion:** Accurate.

### Key Points and the ""Party Switch""
- **Republican Support:** It is accurate that a significant majority of Republicans in both the House and Senate voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act.
- **Democratic Opposition:** It is also accurate that there was more opposition among Democrats, primarily from Southern Democrats.
- **Party Switch Claim:** The statement ‚ÄúAnd no the parties didn‚Äôt switch positions at a later point",1
That‚Äôs a lie.‚Äù oversimplifies a complex historical realignment,2
"The Democratic Party, especially in the South, was historically conservative and opposed to civil rights legislation",0
"However, over time, particularly from the 1960s onwards, the Democratic Party became more progressive, especially on civil rights and social issues, while many Southern conservatives shifted to the Republican Party",1
This shift is often referred to as the Southern Strategy,0
"The modern political landscape is very different from that of the early and mid-20th century.

- **Conclusion:** The description of the party switch is misleading",1
"While it's true that the parties evolved in their platforms and constituencies, stating it as a complete lie ignores significant historical context and scholarly consensus on the realignment.

### Summary
1",1
"**1924 DNC (""Klanbake""):** Mostly accurate, but the description could be toned down to avoid hyperbole.
2",1
"**Civil Rights Act of 1964 Voting:** Accurate.
3",1
