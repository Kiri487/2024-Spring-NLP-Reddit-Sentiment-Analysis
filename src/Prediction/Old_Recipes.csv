"You know, I would not be surprised if a Dad looked over his wife’s shoulder, snuggled his chin into her neck, and asked, “Whatcha making’, honey?” Squints at recipe, and says, “Ooh! Crackerass, huh! Sounds dee-licious!”

And his wife smacks him on the ass and says, “Stahp!”

And Dad runs around the house getting the children all riled up because, “Kids! Kids, guess what your mother is cookin’ for supper?!”

“Crackerass!” (Purposely mispronouncing Caracas!)

And family mayhem ensues, and a fun evening—with some tears from the littlest one, because ass is not good to eat—is had by all.",1
Better than a Bobbit pickle,1
"Plus those wonderful authentic ingredients, apricot jam and canned mandarin oranges",1
Sounds delicious to me!,1
I feel personally attacked...,0
"Omg this sounds sooo good!!!!! When I was young I ate this pie with a Graham cracker crust, and I remember her using strawberry yogurt, whipping cream and jello",1
It was fabulous,1
I still remember it 30 years later and was looking for it! Thank you for this!,0
I’ll allow it.,0
This was my great great great grandmother,1
I am overjoyed that some still share an interest in her cooking.,1
Does anyone have the original recipe for Peanut Butter Chews??,1
Yeah I was thinking maybe they played with the cheese amount,0
Would explain the name a bit,0
"🤷‍♀️
Or they were maybe playing around with a chipped beef dip recipe

Someone out there knows lol",1
K Phoebs ♥️,0
That's more of a scramble,1
The crackerass is a cheese dip judging by the pound of American cheese and serving suggestion,0
"But, you did say it's a reach...",0
So...12 eggs...?,0
🧡🧡🧡🧡,0
"Ok this might be a reach, but maybe related to Eggs a la Caracas? 

https://ahundredyearsago.com/2023/05/07/eggs-a-la-caracas/",1
"Yes, please 😊",0
"Yes, the episodes! There are a few episodes from “Cooking from Quilt Country” on YouTube, but there is nothing from Heartland Cooking that I’ve been able to find.",1
The episodes? She was wonderful to watch.,1
I'd kinda like to see that hot cheese dip!,1
I've read this several times and can't get my head around it lol,1
Love the food styling and illustrations,1
My mom had these cookbooks and I was so obsessed with the Cookie book and Cakes for Celebrations,2
I remember just sitting on the floor of our kitchen paging through them over the years.,0
I don't eat ass of any persuasion.,0
"Reposting here (sorry I included a link to my blog initially) -- I recreated this recipe for crackerass, assuming it was a well-known dish...somewhere",2
"But upon searching, I have not found a single search result for eating crackerass except some unsavory ones having nothing to do with chipped beef",2
Anyone ever heard of this??,0
I wish I could find her Heartland Cooking series - I can’t find it online anywhere!!!,0
Lemon or lemon zest as well,0
It’s a French “daughter sauce.”,0
"Wow, great job! Very cute.",1
"Lol YES! I am 40 years old, and still treat myself to a jar of Hawaiian Delight every now and then😏.",1
"Dammit, I just had a bag of mashed potatoes (frozen and sous vided) I could have put in the jumbo hot dogs we just got! Going to save this one for next time we have mashed potatoes.",1
This is nearly identical to the taco salad we grew up with if you add ground beef and use kidney or red beans instead of garbanzos,1
"You could use any bright red dressing like french, catalina or western",1
The recipe was called White Trash Taco Salad,0
LOL,1
This sounds like what my mom made that she called goulash,0
I'm sure my mom's recipe never resembled real goulash,1
"Ketchup, tomato juice, elbow noodles, ground beef",0
My mom was not a sophisticated cook,1
"She loathed it, but she put dinner on the table every night.",2
That doesnt sound bad at all,2
Try it with macaroni salad!,0
Haha that’s totally what that is!,1
No.,0
It’s just potato salad with a bit of jello texture,0
It’s not wholly gelatinous because the gelatin is mixed with the mayo.,0
I have the Better Homes & Gardens New Cookbook from around the same time,1
It’s the cookbook my mom used most and I still use it on occasion today,1
I loved to read all the how to’s,1
"The book illustrates how we never were, but liked to pretend we could be.",1
"That looks absolutely amazing, great job!! I saw this on America's Test Kitchen/Cooks Country cooking show today and need someone to make it for me, lol",1
😅😍😋,0
I now have to make them once a week now.,0
I remembered strawberry pie without jello,0
The absurdly solid jello pies aren’t as good,1
This reminds me of what I remember.,0
"If it was me, I'd add an additional slice of bacon.",0
I have a handed down family favorite jello salad that has avocado and mayo in it but you’d never know,1
I made it every Thanksgiving.,0
Wt——???!!!!!,0
My dad used to make these for me if mom was out for the evening or out of town,0
I loved it!,1
Looking for Pinnochio and realizing he’s elf on the shelf 😅,0
"So what was it like? Gelatinous tatoes??  Besides the jello, it sounds like a nice potato salad",1
I have never.,0
I need this in my life.,0
"Oh, yeah I totally misunderstood your comment",0
I'm sorry about that.,2
"This would probably be more trouble than it's worth, but it'd be especially cute for a party with lil' smokies or small Japanese-style dogs: Small star-tip, cheesy mashed potatoes, chives",1
(I just read the post about the 1950s party-planning book,0
.),0
No celebration is complete without curry-fried mini-wheats!,1
"Ok, I  may need to try this.",1
Thank you for bringing back summer memories as a teen at my grandma’s house! Sweet nostalgia ♥️,1
"Oh my!! I had sheets just like that , as well!! They were the PERFECT summer sheets!! I had the pillowcases long past the sheets",1
"Took them to college, my first home, and my twins spent many, many snuggle times in them when they were first home from the hospital",1
"Made by Cannon and oooooh sooo soft, yet crunchy like good cotton percale used to be",1
🧡💛 Thank you for the memories warming my heart tonight!My boys will be 29 this summer,0
🥰,0
"I have to say, it does look good.",1
"This is lovely to the eye!! 🧡I am, however, with “mom”",1
"I don’t believe I could get past the texture, either.",2
"I am a Jell-O salad lover but I gotta say, cold velvety potatoes in a gel would be challenging for me.

I love how you garnished this though, I prefer it to the recipe photograph",1
Reminds me of bed sheets I grew up with.,0
I love that you made the decorative flowers!,1
It’s linked in the comments.,0
"I was thinking if you used a piping bag and Star tip, it could actually look kind of elegant.",1
That part I DO recall ...but I love Vanilla & maybe lemon extract,1
Happy Baking! Too bad I mad a reg cake earlier oh well .#soonthiscakeshallbemade 😆,2
"And I agree, some are old Southern classics",1
"I just did not see any past restaurants, that I knew, only current.",2
"Forgot to say, I typically use 2-teaspoons vanilla",2
Some people use almond or other extracts,2
Happy baking.,1
Where is the ingredient list and directions?,0
THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH !,1
"Some of the recipes from the  current restaurants are classic southern dishes,  but I take your point.",1
One recipe for 2 loaf pans.(9x5),0
It also fits in a tube pan,0
Bundt pans are too small.,2
You do 2x's the recipe or does one recipe fit in 2 loaf pans? Thanks for the recipe!,1
Thanks.,1
"Because no recipe was posted with this submission, it has been removed.

This is very interesting and of interest to us here; but, please, repost it with at least one recipe! Thanks!",1
"Oh, I hope you try! I need others on this path to figure out what I am doing!",0
"I feel like chives, sour cream, or scallions should be involved",0
Or a Branston pickle?,0
My mother has this book! I honestly don't think she ever used it,1
Pretty sure it was a wedding present when she got married in the 60s.,1
This was one of my favorites growing up.,0
"Thanks so stock, cream, sometimes mushrooms",1
Thanks.,1
"Yes, I know one of the authors (on a very casual acquaintance level) and see her sometimes at a monthly meeting",2
This was apparently published during Covid and I was not aware it was published,2
I’m going to ask her if she has the recipe or can direct me to someone who might have it,1
One of the owner’s SILs went to work in another food establishment when the restaurant went out of business,0
I suggested to him they (He and another SIL who worked in the business),0
"should write a cookbook, but he did not give a positive response",1
"He was usually out front, so he might not know the recipes",2
He indicated he was frequently asked about several of the classic recipes,1
"During this current search, I have discovered a library where I can check this book out",0
"I have an excessive number of cookbooks now, so I want to ensure it is worth having before buying a copy",1
LOL,1

#Crockery Cookery Know-How
Dinner that cooks by itself is a dream come true to the user of electric slow-crockery cookers",1
The go-off-and-leave-it feature alone is responsible for much of the appliance's popularity,1
"The big question is, '""go off and leave it for how long?"" The answer depends both on the type of cooker and on the food.

**Meet the Crockery Cookers:** Although individual models have different features, slow cookers come in three basic types",2
"Cookers with heating wires wrapped entirely around the sides of the cooker, those with heating elements in the bottom, and those with a separate heating unit like a small hot plate.

We tested the recipes for this book only in those cookers with heating elements wrapped around the sides (illustration 1).\* These pots have very low wattage and the element is on continuously",1
Foods in liquid can be left unattended 8 or more hours without boiling dry or sticking,1
"This group of pots can be identified by the heat control with one or two fixed settings, a Low and High.

The second group, with heating elements in the bottom, usually have thermostatic controls with a wide range of temperatures (illustration 2)",1
The heating unit goes on and off as the thermostat calls for heat,0
In some models the settings on the dial range from very low to high enough for deep fat frying,1
Slow cooking in crockery cookers heated from the bottom is most successful when the user can check the food during cooking to be sure it is hot enough or not boiling too hard,1
An occasional stir also prevents food from sticking to the bottom or sides of the cooker,0
"If you have one of these models, you should not use the recipes in the All-Day Cooking chapter unless you plan to be at home during the cooking time",0
We did not test recipes either in the second group of cookers or in those with a separate heating unit which operates much like a hot plate (illustration 3),1
"In addition to the example shown, some models are shallow like a skillet",2
"The change in shape also affects the heating pattern of the appliance.

**Check Your Cooker:** Just as the design of the slow cooker varies so does its heating capacity",2
"To check the cooking temperature of your particular cooker, fill it half full of cold tap water",1
Cover and set cooker on high-heat setting for 2½ hours,1
"If the water is boiling before 2½ hours, reduce the total cooking time for recipes in this book",0
"If the cooker takes longer than 3 hours to come to boiling, add to the cooking time.

**Food Safety First:** Slow cookers are designed for long cooking periods",2
"Thus, the food heats very slowly particularly on the lowest setting",2
It follows that Low should not be used for meat or egg mixtures that cook less than 6 hours,2
"The food won't get hot enough in that amount of time to be sure of destroying bacteria.

Proper handling of foods before and after cooking is another important aspect of crockery cooking",1
Don't use the cooker to store food at room temperature either before or after cooking,0
"While you'll want to do some advance preparation the night before, you must store the ingredients in the refrigerator and transfer them to the cooker in the morning",0
"Likewise, as soon as the meal is served, remove the food from the cooker",0
"Refrigerate the food while still warm, or cool it over a bowl of ice water and freeze or store in the refrigerator.

**Useful Tips:** Before using the crockery cooker for the first time, read the instruction booklet so you can learn about specific features",1
As you use the cooker you may find it becomes hot to the touch during the long cooking time,1
"Use heavy potholders to move the cooker and place the cord so it will not hang over the counter where it can be touched or tangled accidentally.

Sudden temperature changes will damage the ceramic liner of the cooker",2
"Thus, never put cold food or water in a hot cooker",1
Turn on the cooker only after foods are in the pot,0
"Also, never place the cooker in the refrigerator because condensation on the electrical parts may interfere with the proper performance.

Unless the instruction book says the pot is immersible, do not plunge the cooker in water",0
Avoid abrasive cleaners and cleaning pads,0
Scratches in the liner can trap food particles that never completely come out,2
"For easiest clean up, add warm water to the cooker just after removing the food.

From the beginning of the book to the end, you will discover exciting crockery cooking recipes for any occasion.

"This version features a creamy sauce, mushrooms, and slivered almonds",0

Ingredients:  
2 tablespoons butter (divided)  
6 oz mushrooms (sliced)  
1 onion (chopped)  
Salt and pepper (to taste)  
1 cup chicken stock  
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour  
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder  
1/4 teaspoon paprika  
1/4 teaspoon onion powder  
1 tablespoon fresh chopped parsley  
1/2 cup slivered almonds  
3 lbs shredded chicken  
1 cup Italian breadcrumbs  
Instructions:  
Heat 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium heat",1

In a separate saucepan, melt the remaining butter",0

Slowly add chicken stock, whisking continuously",2
"Season with garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper",0
"Simmer until thickened.  
Preheat the oven to 350°F.  
Layer shredded chicken, sauce, mushrooms, and almonds in a greased baking dish",2
"Top with breadcrumbs and melted butter.  
Bake for 40-45 minutes or until browned around the edges.  
Serve with rice, noodles, or bread2.",1
My mom called these Pronto Pups,0
Exactly like this but she fancied them up with a sprinkle of paprika.,1
"I would say the visual color and look of the sauce is much like this one.

https://www.meilleurduchef.com/en/recipe/poached-chicken-sauce-supreme.html

I did consider the name may have come from a supreme cut of chicken",2
"It was only a chicken breast when I ate it, but who knows if they made a change, due to cost and availability options for the chicken",2
"Here is another option I looked at, but the sauce on the above looks more correct in color and consistency.

https://www.kitchensanctuary.com/chicken-supreme/

I do wonder if the chicken was poached in a chicken broth mixture or milk?  Of course I don’t know if it was poached",2
"Just going off tenderness and moisture of the chicken.

Edited for that darn autocorrect and grammar.",2

Yum!,0
Moderation is good for most things in life.,1
"Yummy-but-not-healthy, maybe for the holidays (safely 6 months away).",1

"It’s from 1959, and the forced narrative in the US at the time was that women stayed in the home and made cake boats or whatever",2
"These books were designed to mask the real labor that went into running a household, reducing it to fashioning centerpieces and entertaining the neighbors",1
Of course they didn’t have time on their hands to do everything plus the idealized perfection of this book,1
We’re like on the same side.,0
"Edit 
My comment was made after an error in me misunderstanding the original post",1
"But I won't delete for continuity sake 


They had very little time on their hands because they were running a household",2
"Also, what makes you believe that the only people that used this cookbook were women who didn't work outside the home?",0
"Wow, this sounds like a good idea! Growing up my mom made hot dogs stuffed with bread stuffing (like the Thanksgiving kind) made with onions and celery",1
"They were great, and I made them for us when my son was growing up",1
He loved them too.,1

Great book! Looks like a fascinating read with slices of what life was idealized to be at the time.,1
Oh cool,1
After much research I think it is likely a version of a supreme sauce,1
Of course there are so many small ingredient variations they could have used,1
"It either had a white wine or sherry in it, I lean toward the sherry",0
"The sauce was neutral in flavor, but silky",0
"A thinner sauce which did cling, maybe because of the chicken breading",2
"No heaviness, or cream of soup vibe",0
No cheese was detected,0
"It was definitely not a sauce of visual interest with the rather blond sauce (Almost a slight yellow tone) over a boneless, skinless, breaded, fried breast and served over white rice",2
"I think the almonds were sprinkled on for visual and taste texture, it was just a few on top",1
Their chicken also seemed very tender and was always moist,2
"Could it have been poached or something prior to service to speed the prep?  While it visually looked like a piece of fried chicken, it was not today’s version of excessive breading",2
"It was a “fine” breading, not heavy or thick, mostly probably to keep the chicken moist and give the sauce something to cling to",1
I’m still trying to recall the exact flavor of the breading,1
"Since the sauce was spooned over it, one drug any bare pieces through the overrun on the plate",1
I do think the breading was a bit heavy on the black pepper,2
I just did not eat the chicken bare to recall more,1
"I do not remember any onion, the sauce was thin enough, I do not think it contained any puréed ingredients",2
My husband and I differ,0
"I say maybe a wee bit of minced mushrooms, but he did not recall that",0
"He actually has a good pallet, so his judgement is as good as mine",1
"The chicken could be ordered any day, even the days it was not on the lunch options",2
That tells me it was likely easy prep,1
"Was it made from a base sauce which they used for many dishes?  The owners were Lebanese, but did not offer the ethnic food on their menu",1
"The dishes had no ethnic vibe, so I think the nationality is a moot point",0
It was classic upscale food of the 50’s with white tablecloths and suited waiters,1
"They offer a bit of everything, the menu was large, beef, pork, chicken, seafood",1
West Indies salad was one of their signature appetizers,0
"Lots of seafood options, especially gulf coast, which was nearby",1
"They closed almost 20 years ago, so my memory and taste buds are not as sharp",2
"At the time, I just did not cook as extensively as I currently do",1
"This local restaurant attempts to do the dish due to the local popularity, but it falls flat in preparation",2
You might find the description helpful,0
This is everything the two of us can recall,0

I imagine it's referring to the types of cans that Planters nuts come in.,0
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,0
I use the Jello brand of lemon pudding that you add egg to.,0

The cake is *quite* tough but it’s still good and it’s easy",1
"It’s neat how the cake puffs up and pulls away from the pan.
 Not quite related- but my chopped up raspberries and strawberries mixed with sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg made a delicious filling.",1
Same!,0
"Hiya..
I'm trying to find the chicken rub from the 1994 book.
Featured a lot of brown sugar and liquid smoke I believe...dried in the oven prior to use.
Any help appreciated",2
"It’s in the oven right now!  Though, I made a few adjustments to use what I had on hand:
1",1
"I swapped butter for margarine
2",0
"I swapped some strawberries and raspberries cooked with sugar for canned pie filling 


Updates to come when it’s out of the oven!",0
Can you store the bread in the jars or do I need to remove it from the jars when it cooled?,0
Excellent!,1
I keep hoping someone donates the red cover Rumford book to our local library!! I have the blue one-with the 1908 and 1918 copyrights,0
🤭,0
Also depends on the region,0
Bavaria alone has about 5 or so different dialekts...,0
Commenting to say that I made this salad today for my family (including my Irish- and German-American husband) and it was a hit! I used your recipe as a base but included the additions of milk and flour from a comment..,2
And it tasted exactly like the potato salad we've enjoyed at the local German Family Society,1
Thank you for sharing.,0
More than likely it's left over dry kaiser rolls or schrippen.,1
Rehrücken is deer backstrap,0
"Thanks, must try them!",1
Sand tarts are thin and have a snap to them but they do have a cinnamon and sugar sprinkled onto the tops before they are baked,2
So yes they do have some flavor like a snickerdoodle.,0
"These sound like they'd taste like snickerdoodles, which I love",1
Do they?,0
Are these for sale?,0
"Some more anecdotal evidence: I was born and raised in NH, with a grandma right over the border from Amesbury, MA, who loved lemon meringue",1
The only brand she used to make hers at home was Royal,0
Do you remember a red box?,0
I am so glad I got several peoples memories unlocked with this recipe,1
These are one of my families favorite cookies,1
Let me know if they are what you remember.,0
Memory unlocked,0
My great grandmother used to make these,1
She would spend a whole week making them,1
We could never get them as thin as she did,2
I will have to try them using your recipe,0
The pictures look about as thin as hers,2
She used the colored sprinkling sugars I stead of nuts.,0
"I’m so glad! I hope you enjoy your fudge as much as everyone loves mine! Thanks for sharing, too! Enjoy! ☺️",1
"same, had to look twice to confirm this is an actual food recipe",0
Pretty much the same recipe I was taught to make peach cobbler,1
But with fresh peaches cooked in a little sugar instead of canned pie filling.,1
"I read “1 teas BABY powder” at first and thought man, that is crazy.",2
The alcohol will cook the egg yolks when you combine them,0
As for the whites it would be similar to the uncooked meringue you'd find on a lemon meringue pie,0
"Since the eggs sold in US stores are pasteurized in the shell, which is why they need to be refrigerated, unlike European eggs, the risk of salmonella is pretty small but admittedly not zero.",1
"My mom makes this, maybe it's what you are looking for- [https://lifewithdee.com/busy-day-swiss-steak-a-vintage-recipe/](https://lifewithdee.com/busy-day-swiss-steak-a-vintage-recipe/)",1
Read baby powder instead of baking powder and thought I guess that’s what makes it crazy.,2
You are very welcome!,1
Thank you so much for the story and the recipe! Definitely going to try making these!,1
Sounds delicious.,1

"I have not had scrapple that way, I just make slices, fry, and eat it with over easy eggs.",1
"RemindMe! May 27, 2027",0
What do you put on Scrapple sandwiches then?,0
"This looks pretty similar to an old ""cobbler"" recipe I picked up somewhere, except that one includes an egg and uses fresh fruit tossed with sugar.

I like it with peaches and vanilla or a little bit of cinnamon and fresh pears.",1
I guess we know who has the sweet tooth! Oh that would be me lol.,1
I like mine with ketchup,0
"I have, every once in a while I will get a small block of it and slice and pan fry it",2
I do like mine with maple syrup on it.,0
Do you cook it?,0
"I've made it with a whole can of cherry pie filling and, yesterday I made it with about two cups of homemade strawberry rhubarb pie filling",1
Both times it came out great.,1
Of course!!!! My Scottish grandfather loved scrapple lol.,1

"So that means the carrot cake recipe is from 1979??

I'm trying to find out when/what year it won the Blue Ribbon award.

I think we used to call this crazy crust,2
I loved baking this when I was a kid,1
Quick and easy,1
Thanks for posting!,1
This is just like the ‘Rhubarb Pie’ recipe except it uses oleo instead of butter,0
And prepared pie mix instead of rhubarb,0
Seems like the ratio of ingredients and no eggs was popular in those days,1
"https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/s/bWjofHc7Tm

A whole can of prepare pie filling seems a lot",1
Have you made this? How many ounces was the can of filling?,1
"I’m thrilled to have found this, thank you for sharing!",1
Definitely!!!,0
I think there is a comment on my site that says someone used a pasta rolling machine,0
Everyone has come up with some very creative ways to make them thin.😉,1
Oooh I misunderstood,0
"Definitely egg wash, then!",0
The egg wash is what will give you that snap😀,0
Same.,0
I wonder if this dough would roll thin enough in a pasta rolling machine.,2
This is just a dump cake pre-cake mix,0
DON’T MIX IT!,0
"I'm not a fan of sugar cookies so I might like this recipe better, although I'd leave off the egg wash because that snap is what I like best!",1
"You are right also, I have heard of people using a sugar cookie",1
But when you add the egg wash on the top before you bake them they don’t quite snap the same,1
Most leave that off I have heard.,1
Actually I have had a couple of people in the comment say they make it into a log and slice them,0
I could never get mine straight or thin enough that way,1
So you are correct in thinking that.,0
Mine has cinnamon and a pecan,0
"But people also use walnuts, or colored sugar",0
So many versions,1
Let me know how you like them.,0
Please let me know after you have baked them,0
There are tons of ways to get them paper thin so please read the post and maybe some of the comments,2
People have come of with some clever ideas,1
😀,0
The book was first published in 1979,1
So I wasn’t too far off.,1
"My MIL is from that area and I've talked to various relatives about their recipes.

She and her sister use a standard sugar cookie recipe rolled paper thin with coarse sugar on top, and that's what they call sand tarts",1
No one in their family uses pecans (although some of them have nut allergies so that could be why),0
"When looking at the ingredient list on a package of sand tarts at a farmer's market, I noticed those didn't include any leavening, which I guess would help keep them paper thin, but that doesn't align with most recipes I've seen online",1
ETA although the linked recipe might be a match!!,0
"Thank you so much for explaining this to me.

And thank you for asking your mum about the age of this carrot cake recipe! I really appreciate it",1
The powered sugar allows for a much smoother batter as opposed to the grainy texture granulated sugar would create,1
"Basically, the granulated sugar will not dissolve the same way that powered sugar will.",0
"Sand Tarts! I didn't know about these until I moved to Lancaster County after college, but they're delicious",1
"The versions I've had have always just had sugar sprinkled on top, I'll have to try making them with a pecan instead!",1
We used something I recall as Lem,0
It had a ball of lemon juice that would break open and dissolve once it was heated.,0
Omg,0
I think this just unlocked a childhood memory of my great grandmother making cookies that may have been similar,1
I could have sworn she used the word “log” though… I know they definitely had “Pennsylvania Dutch” in the name,0
Idk if they were exactly this cookie though?,1
Oh wow! Over the years I have recalled a cookie my mom’s friend would make at Christmas,1
I could never quite put my finger on it; it was a distant memory from the 60’s,2
They are both long gone so I had no way of asking,2
"I kept thinking it was like a sugar cookie but not exactly, and *poof* here it is! I may have to muster up and try making these just to recreate that memory!",2
Any chance it was a Rocky Mountain cake? That would probably include marshmallows,0
"Do you think it might have had coconut or dates in it? If it was decorated with walnuts, maybe they were in the cake batter too?",0
I’ve used either one in the spinach dip and people still liked it.,1
Reviving a bit of an old thread here but seems like one of y'all would have an enlightened opinion on the matter,1
"Is there a noticeable difference between the two? The Leek mix is only available via shipping, but I have time before the graduation party",1
Just wondering if it's so much better to bother with the hassle when the vegetable mix is right in the store?,1
"It’s based on your meat, if it’s 80/20 from the store you’ll need to drain after browning, we use grass fed, very lean, beef so don’t have to drain.",2
So after browning the hamburger do you drain it? New to all of this,1
Lol,1
So do you add the seasoning packets after it cools or do you throw those away? It doesn’t say,0
"Oh my, I made the carousel cake for my son’s 1st birthday",1

I haven't had lemon meringue pie in a long time.,2
This is the only answer,0
"I use a can of Eagle Brand Milk, fresh squeezed lemon juice and a little grated lemon rind for my “lemon icebox pies” complete with meringue",1
My aunt used the Royal brand,0
She added a couple of egg yolks and lemon juice and grsted lemon rind,0
I've used jello brand using her additions and it turned out great.,1
It could be Royal,0
"My mom always preferred Royal, and I seem to recall that their lemon was good.",1
Greens lemon meringue pie mix,0
"This is my guess, too",0
"Maybe Grandma likes it super sweet? Mine is sweet, but not overpoweringly so",1
"I could see piling it high on a cupcake.

The recipe I use is:

* 1 cup milk
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* 1/2 cup vegetable shortening (room temperature)
* 1/2 cup butter (room temperature)

* pinch of salt
* 3 tbsp cocoa

It was Royal brand,0
I used it all the time in the 90s because I LOVE lemon meringue pie and it was so quick and easy to whip up the filling on the stovetop,1
"Duncan Hines has a canned lemon pie filling.....I haven't bothered trying it, though.",0
What does the confectioners sugar do vs regulate granulated sugar?,0
That’s the one my mom made too,0
The old box images look familiar,1
This might be it,0
It was definitely not jell-o,0

"Good luck!  Like many of the people commenting here, my mother had a jar of this on the counter when I was growing up - I believe she got the starter from a friend at the school where she taught",1
"Some time in the 1980s it was either disposed of or otherwise lost, and I've been looking for a starter for ages",0
"Actually asked around various cooking newsgroups several times over the past 30 years, and this thread is the first time I've gotten further than ""yeah, my family had that too, no clue how to make it"" responses.

We never baked anything with ours - only used it as ice-cream topping - but essentially once it's going - it'll bubble a bit continuously once fermentation starts - just scoop out some to use, re-fill whatever you took out with fruit, dump in a cup or so of sugar, and leave it be",1
"In a week or two it'll be ready for you to steal more for another bowl of ice cream :-)

If someone asked me to wager, I'd bet that the origin of the ""traditional"" Smithsonian recipe used an alcoholic beverage as the initial starter both because it kept the fruit from spoiling until fermentation took over, and because alcohols were probably less purified when this recipe originated, so there was likely to be carryover yeast that came with the alcohol",1
"Today we're relying on capturing local yeast out of the air, which isn't difficult, but also isn't as sure a thing as force-starting the fermentation with yeast that you know is there.

If I find that it has trouble starting with the brew as proposed by the Smithsonian,  I think I'll toss in a couple slices from a local apple that hasn't been washed/waxed",1

Thank you! I might have to try them all!,0
Thank you! That looked like a great recipe.,1
Thank you very much!,1
Thank you! I think the top crust was buttery but subbing butter for vegetable shortening would work.,1
Thank you!,0

You are very welcome!,1
So I'm not the only Psychopath here,0
That's good to know,1
My grandmother used to make them with pickels,0
So good.,1
I have found that when cooking in my toaster/over air fryer thingy that I usually have to lay a piece of foil over whatever I am cooking so the top does not burn,1
"This should work in a regular oven, too",0
Take the foil off near the end of the cooking time.,1
They were fantastic! They tasted exactly like the recipe I used to have ! Thank you so very much 🤗,1
Wow! That’s way off! So glad you got the thermometer!,1
For a quick dish I use dirty rice box mix and then add petite diced tomatoes and cut up pepper tops to it,2
For cooking base I'll use can or jar tomato sauce whatever is in cupboard.  A bit of sauce on top and some fresh grated parm or mozzarella cheese sprinkled lastly,1
You can basically do what you want for the filling and just follow the instructions for cooking .,0
I have had this book since the late 80's! Wonderful Book,1
It has the best cheese cake recipe you will ever find! And plenty more that will amaze you.,1
Thank you for the metal vs,0

I'm certain the top would have been burned if I hadn't.,1
I FORGOT ABOUT THAT COOKBOOK,0
My oven has a quick preheat,1
So while preheating it’s more or less broiling,1
You can’t cold start any baking in it.,1

"My oven is small, only a 27”",2
For that reason the elements are too close to the cake during preheating,0
I have made this cake since the 1980s and had the small oven since the 1990s,2
I alway preheat my oven,0
"I agree with the low temperature, but preheating is not essential",0
"In my current oven, the two loaf pans work best",1
"It allows the center to fully cook, without drying out the outside edges of the cake",0
"My suggestion would be to preheat, or place a pice of foil over the top of the pan to protect the top during preheating",1
"It is essential not to seal the foil to the pan, but simply lay it over the pan to allow for full escape of the steam.",1
Absolutely,1
My oven preheats with both the bottom element and the broiler.,0

Even better! Pumpernickel is my favorite bread!,1
I hope you enjoy! We like to do it casserole style and then use chunks of pumpernickel bread to dip in it.,1
That sounds delicious! Saving for later.,1
"I made the Omaha Cake earlier this evening and oh my goddess it is DELICIOUS 🥰🥰🥰🥰 when I went to Kroger for a few ingredients I didn't have on hand (including pie filling) I opted for the peach because for some strange reason, I was jonesing for peach lol I have got to make it again because I wanna taste every pie filling flavor 🍑🍎🍒🍓 incidentally, I'm having a second piece as I write this 😁",1

**THICK-CRUST PEACH COBBLER**

*Ingredients*

10–12 ripe peaches, peeled and sliced

1 cup sugar

1/3 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

1/2 cup melted butter or margarine

2 tablespoons cornstarch

7 tablespoons water (divided)

1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

1/2 teaspoon salt

1/2 cup vegetable shortening (such as Crisco)


*Directions*

Place the peaches in a medium saucepan",2
"Add the sugar, spices, and butter (or margarine).

Mix the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons cold water, then add to the peach mixture",2
"Simmer, stirring gently, over low-to-medium heat, about 15 minutes, until a thick syrup forms.

As the fruit cooks, place the flour, salt, shortening, and 5 tablespoons of warm water in a bowl and mix them together thoroughly by hand to make a dough.

Preheat oven 350°

Pour the peach mixture into a greased 13 × 9-inch baking pan",1
Scoop tablespoons of dough into the peach mixture throughout the pan,0
These will cook and spread among the peaches as the cobbler bakes,0
"Bake for about 30 minutes, until the dough browns",0
"Serve hot, with or without ice cream, as you prefer.”",1
"Our older electric stove, when you turn it on it starts a preheat mode",1

This recipe says it's from Southern Living June 1997.",1
Found this recipe for Gullah Peaches and Cream Pie! Sounds like a cobbler in a pie crust,0
"Maybe you can recreate the cobbler recipe from this:

INGREDIENTS

2 pounds fresh peaches
1 standard pie shell
½ cup flour
½ cup light brown sugar
¼ teaspoon salt
1 stick butter
½ cup sugar
½ teaspoon cinnamon
1 egg
2 tablespoons heavy cream
1 teaspoon vanilla

DIRECTIONS

1) Wash and peel peaches and slice thinly",1
"Set aside.
2) Make sure pie shell is completely thawed.
3) Mix together flour, brown sugar, and salt",1
Use a pastry cutter or fork to blend in butter,0
"Mixture should resemble coarse crumbs.
4) Measure half of the flour mixture and sprinkle evenly over pie crust bottom.
5) Place the peaches over the flour mixture",2
"Sprinkle sugar and cinnamon over peaches.
6) Whisk together egg, cream, and vanilla and pour over sliced peaches.
7) Top with remaining flour mixture.
8) Bake at 400 degrees for about 45 minutes.",1
It's not going to ruin your pound cake baking it in a pre-heated oven! You'll merely lessen the baking time and the test pick will come out with just a few crumbs,0
"Cool for 10-min in the pan(s), then remove and finish cooling on a rack.",1
I think it’s the delicious crunchy sweet crust you get,1
I actually stored mine upside down because I baked it in a Bundt pan,2
"I didn’t want that crunchy top to get soft sitting on the bottom, so I flipped it out of the pan and then flipped it back, crunchy side UP! 😋",1
Some ovens (like mine) preheat using convection and so when it's at 320 on convection (preheating to 325) I think that would feel much hotter than the intended temperature,1
"I was surprised that it didn't burn in my oven, given those circumstances.",1
Here's a breakdown for a cold oven start,2
"The trademark of a cold oven pound cake is a thick, golden-brown crust, with a flavor reminiscent of toasty caramel",2
"Baking your pound cake low and slow helps it develop a gorgeous, thick, and caramelized crust, truly setting it apart from your standard pound cake.

Starting your pound cake in a cold oven also impacts the texture of the cake",1
"A longer bake time and lower temperature allows the leavening more time to work before the cake sets, resulting in a taller, fluffier cake",1
"The thick crust seals in all the fluffy, moist goodness beneath the surface, helping the cake to stay good on your countertop for up to 5 days.

Thank you ☺️ that sounds fantastic,1
"We pretty much just ate it plain, it's awesome!  The crunchy crust is amazing",1
"But it also goes well with like fresh fruit and whipped cream, and with lemon curd and creme fraiche",1
"Probably goes well with a bunch of other stuff too, but I would suggest something a little light/tangy/fresh because the cake itself is sweet and rich and dense.",1
"Hello my hubby is remembering a sausage ball that his grandma once made for him, he says this could be the one.",0
I was wondering if we could perhaps get your recipe,0
Please,0
Thank you either way,0
I don’t think I’ve ever eaten pound cake! I’m keen to try this recipe,0

My hips are growing just reading this,0
I’m definitely making it!,0
I made this too and used less sugar (maybe half) because I ran out,2
I did brown sugar and cinnamon on top and skipped the glaze,1
It was plenty sweet.,1
WOW! What an incredible find!!!,1
Where can I find the recipe? Nasvillians remember this,0
"While by description, the ""spaghetti"" thing my mother's family made sounds kind of similar to American goulash, I haven't met a goulash-ish thing that is a close match",1
"Flavor of course is subject to one's own particular selection of spices, but when I say it was dry, I really do mean dry",1
"To look at it, you'd have said it was just really-well-drained browned ground beef, a few dry bits of chopped vegetables, and grated parmesan cheese, tossed in with spaghetti noodles",1
"A light sheen of grease from the beef was as much liquid as you'd be able to find.

Reviewing Bolognese recipes I can find online, ingredients-wise they look like a possible promising origin, but they are all much wetter than whatever the heck it was that we made",1
I shall continue to study!,0
"My family also made this in the depression era!! Such a nostalgic meal for me, and always a favorite",1

How do I find a particular cookbook which is out of print?,1
Don't feel bad about buying a physical copy,2
Nothing on the internet is permanently available and having a hard copy of something you really love is never a bad thing.,1
I remember when personal email became a thing (not like work email),0
"People sent variations on chain mail letters via email and it was a mess because everyone forwarded the thing to everyone on their DL, and you got the thing so many times!

Nowadays, it's the ""like and share"" thing on social media sites.",1
I agree,0
Even went and checked out every possible click point and..,0
nothing,0
Bummer.,0
I checked out this recipe and I am confused as to why people go through all this with the “starter” and comments about yeast/no yeast when the recipe uses a yellow cake mix from the box,2
"That will have all the leavening needed, won’t it? Why go through the fermentation process? Is it just to get the fruit preserved? I’m not understanding the need for starter.",0
I found the strawberries too wet for the batter...it's good the day-of but it's a soggy mess next-day,1
"With the sugar content of peaches it becomes more like a syrup, which when pan-fried in butter- omg it's so good with just a dollop of whipped cream.",1
They were just like Fun-Honeydew described,1

We used to make this soup every year many times with the Hickory Farms Chutter Cheese and Leek Soup Mix,1
But we would always use Riunite White Wine with it paired with cubed large french or other bread with a nice crust and chewy center!! It was a staple and I am sorry to see they don't sell the products any more!,1
">some kind of food borne illness risk

Well now i'm wondering if I'm the one who misunderstood, because with this recipe, that definitely does seem like a risk!",1
This is the correct answer,0
You should start over,0
"Though liquor steeped fruit is lovely, you’re now making a traditional fruit cake",1
You’ll need leavening,0
In the other method the yeast provides that,2
(As it does for breads.,0
"Oh my gosh, I think I misread your initial comment, lol",1
"I definitely know what chain mail is, so this makes sense now! I read your reply as you warning anyone who followed the recipe that there might be dire consequences",2
I thought maybe it carried some kind of food borne illness risk!,1
I just made this,0
I’m waiting for it to cool,1
"I had sweet cream, but not salted so I added 1/4 tsp of talk to the butter plus the 1/2 tsp to the batter",1
I’ll see how it turns out,0
Thank you!!,0
Yeah ours got fruit flies in it,0
There was no coming back from that for us.,0
I remember it being so good!  I am tempted to make it again.,1
I was thinking of trying it with strawberries but peaches sound good too!,1
"Me and my brother did that, but we ate all the fruit and killed mom's starter",2
Man was she pissed,0
haha,1
"The phrase ""Additional cheese"" was actually nearly added to the articles of confederation it's so american",1
"Oh this is hilarious...sub the rhubarb for peaches, and it's our Peach Cobbler 😂",1
"Super tasty with vanilla ice cream, and now I can't wait to try it with rhubarb!!",1
"You may need to put more liquid in to cover the fruit, otherwise it's likely to mold",1
I know that's a concern for other fermented recipes as well,2
You could add a sterile weight to keep the fruit submerged if you can't adjust the liquid level in the jar.,0
"You know what chain mail is, right? Kind of a dead art form now, but my cousin used to keep every chain letter she got and she built up quite a collection",1
"They were always vague about what the consequences would be for you, but usually had some helpful examples of what had happened to others who failed to send on the letter to the requisite number of recipients",2
"Basically, always a series of terrible misfortunes culminating in death (by supernatural intervention, presumably).

Super cheerful trend! I didn't know it included recipes though.",2
"My grandma had this going in the 70""s",0
I can still smell the booze!,0
You're not going to get fermentation if the alcohol content is higher than 10% or so,1
The point of adding the yeast is that they readily consume the sugar to produce alcohol,1
"By adding liquor instead you are making it harder for microbes to ferment the sugars and also depriving it of cultivated yeast, the most alcohol-tolerant fermenters that exist (save for acetobacteria)",1
"Wild yeasts present in the ambient air die at around 5-6% abv, and won't even begin fermentation unless it's much lower than that.

But also, the [Smithsonian recipe](https://folklife.si.edu/magazine/foodways-holidays-30-day-cake) was written by an intern who does not appear to understand how fermentation happens (or missed an important ingredient in their recipe)",1
"I don't think this is going to work, but please do keep us updated.",0
We had something similar sitting on our counter when I was in high school,1
But we called it brandied fruit,0
My sister and I (both underage) were the main consumers of it over ice cream,1
That shit was good and had quite the kick.,1
"Hello! I'm sorry for coming onto a year-old thread, but I was wondering if you could share the contributors list? I had Norwegian family in Tacoma and while the chance that they contributed to this is tiny, it would still be really neat to find out",1

I'll bite- what are the dire consequences?,2
I just took a listen on YouTube,0
Hilarious.,1
"I have starter juice in my freezer, been doing it for 30 years! The peaches I think always make it dreamy even though I don’t like peaches.",1
It is! Found several recipes for it here so I figured with all the starter and no friends brave enough to take any- I will try multiple recipes,1
The German song about rhubarb has been in high rotation at my house,1
Barbaras Rhubarb,0
I’d add vanilla,0
Rhubarb loves vanilla.,0
"The original post with the recipe:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/s/QhTL78oEk5",1
"1 year in the future, I just made this cake, it was spot on and perfect",1
"I used it for a rhubarb buckle cause I didn't feel like making a pie crust and I'm never making rhubarb pie again, my goodness what a concoction.",0
Margarine needs to be substituted with butter or another fat that isn't pure fat - water affects baking outcome.,2
Margarine is also usually cheaper than butter.,2
Crisco and margarine were lifesavers for Kosher cooks who wanted to be able to have a dessert with a meat meal and also avoid treif fats like lard,1
"Also, shortening specifically is a substitute for lard and other pure fats with no added water - water content affects baking",1
Butter and margarine both contain some water (butter iirc about 20%) so can't be substituted for shortening 1:1.,0
"Lard or solid coconut oil would be the best sub for crisco, and butter instead of margarine",1
Can you not get non-hydrogenated margarine?,0
"Just ate a baked potato with margarine (because it's cheaper than butter and I'm poor), no hydrogenated fats in it",2
It's just an emulsion of oil and water like butter is.,0
"I believe the alcohol in the ""make the starter"" step is really just there to keep the initial fruit/sugar batch from spoiling before it manages to acquire enough local yeasts to start fermentation",1
"As long as the alcohol content is high enough, pretty much any alcohol will probably do, though rum, brandy or schnapps seem more likely to be useful than wine/beer/any cream-liqueur, etc",1
Ultimately you're aiming for a self-fermenting batch of fruit and sugar that will overwhelm whatever alcohol you started with,0
"As much as the Smithsonian recipe may be ""traditional"", I would bet that you can get to a working, self-sustaining culture using champagne yeast faster and more reliably...

Freeze, or just keep taking some out and tossing in more fruit and sugar and leave it on the counter",1
"You want the fermenting yeast culture to remain alive (it should survive freezing, and will just go dormant rather than die if it runs out of sugar to ferment -- it can remain dormant for quite a while before dying)",1
"Don't cook/can, as that will kill the yeast culture.",0
I emailed,0
"Is this sometimes called Friendship Cake? If so, I’ve had or only once and, hot dog, it was good! Can’t wait to see how your cake turns out.",1

My father loved two dishes from childhood: Shrimp Wiggle (served on saltines) and Creamed Salmon on Toast,1
"Grandmother’s recipes had no veggies or seasoning other than salt.

I like them flat and crispy on the edges with a bit of chew towards the middle,2

That’s the one I grew up making and it’s perfect imo,1

They come out very rich and soft unless they are left in longer and become crispy,1
I leave some crispy because my grandson likes them that way.,0
Cups (imperial) do not convert to grams (metric) as the first is volume while the second is a measure of weight,1

"My mom stands by a pie crust recipe with Crisco and butter, but mine comes out great with butter only",1
I guess I get it,0
"But margarine in a poundcake? I feel like this is influenced by the 1970s notion that margarine is better for you than butter, which has been proven to be a goddamn fib!! Also poundcake should never be fluffy",1
Give me a dense brick of poundcake or give me death.,0
"Hi, new accounts aren't able to post or comment for a few weeks",1
"You did post mostly correctly, just noting that we typically don't allow people to post their own blogs here unless the full recipe is placed in the post or in the first comment",1
So this one would have been removed even with an older account for those reasons.,1
It sounds a lot like American Goulash,0
"It was really popular during WWII because it made the most of ingredients on hand and could stretch a small ration of ground beef to feed a lot of hungry mouths.

The main ingredients were pasta, ground beef, chopped onions, chopped bell pepper, some parmesan cheese if you had it and at the very end, some chopped tomatoes",1
"My mom made it that way for years, then switched over to a small can of tomato paste instead of the chopped tomatoes",2
"I don't remember her putting any spices or herbs in it, but maybe she did and I just didn't have the palate to realize it as a kid.",0
"96% of the time, that is true 38% of the time",1
💯,0
"Same! I like them ice cold, and when there is a settled almost rubbery layer at the bottom you can peel from the crust",2
"It's hard to describe the ""flavor."" Mmmm..",2
milk and flour.,0
I'm a Hoosier and I fucking looove sugar cream pie!,2
The Southern Living Cookbook has a recipe that I think is what you're looking for,0
You might need a free account,1
"This link should take you to the page but if it doesn't, it's Vanilla Cream Pie, page 363",0
"You can zoom in to make the text more legible.   https://archive.org/details/southernlivingco00sout/page/n9/mode/1up?q=%22cream+pie%22 


Edit: I should add that there's a picture so you can see if it looks like what you're looking for.",1
"Just like one of the commenters on the Serious Eats recipe, I have never seen one made with cinnamon or any spices either",2
They are barely even vanilla flavored,1
Very bland but rich in a great way.,1
"https://www.ohiosamishcountry.com/recipes/amish-sugar-cream-pie

Sugar pie maybe? Some other recipes seem to call it cream pie 

https://www.midwestliving.com/recipe/pies/amish-cream-pie/

(Not Amish, or anything close, just curious)",2
"I know this as a Finger Pie, similar to a hoosier Sugar Cream Pie",0
Very stiff/firm baked floury custard that you barely stir and takes a very long time in the oven,2
A lot like a Water Pie but with richer ingredients,0
"The filling kind of becomes one with the bottom crust and a browned skin forms on the top, patchy and blistered.

Wick's that is famous for Sugar Cream Pie and many Amish groceries sell one very similar,1
I am wondering if this is what she is talking about.,0

Perfect thank you so much,1
No frozen peaches,0
Canned,0
You need the syrup they’re in.,0
Frozen peaches,0
Yes or no and do you still make it the same way,0
Mine used Vegeta!,0
"Does anyone know how old this recipe is???? And can anyone explain to me what ""Blue Ribbon"" is? (I did not grow up in the USA) 

My sister baked this cake when I was growing up in the 80's and  I made this carrot cake over the weekend with my niece! It's seriously the best!!!",1
Your coworkers sound like ungrateful jerks,1
I would have dove headfirst into that cake.,0
Sounds like when my mom made American goulash,0
"Ground beef, drained canned tomatoes, paprika, green bell pepper, onion, and loads of black pepper",2
She mixed in the pasta right before serving.,1
Anyone know the recipe for their lemon almond chicken salad? I used to have it but can't find it anywhere now.,2
Shortening based buttercream crusts more than butter,1
So I'd consider looking into that,0
I make a standard American butter cream with half butter half shortening and I love it,1
But I doubt that's exactly what you're looking for because 2 inches would be too sweet,1
That's interesting,1
"My grandmother also made a similar ketchup based sauce, but with ground beef",0
I also made a post about it a while back,0
In my case the critical ingredient was ketchup that gave it it's distinct flavor but I'm not sure what the exact recipe was,1
I think hers might have been some kind of depression-era thing,1
She was from the southern US.,0
They say 73% of all statistics are made up on the spot,0
Oh I will!! Thanks for the recipe! 💜,1
I have a Vincent Price cookbook which him and his wife Mary did together and I also have a handwritten note that says bon appetit Mary and Vincent Price and the cookbook is in English and French.,0
"these are intriguing, but I wonder if the author of the article really read the recipe",1
"There is no way this is a ""savory"" cookie -- it has 2 cups of sugar in addition to the BBQ sauce, which is traditionally sweet as well",1
I may have to try these,0
Thanks for sharing!,1
Did your grandmother know what gluten was?,0
Definitely not raisins,0
"I can't be sure about olives, but I don't believe so.",1
Not here in Canada,0
In Canada and Europe it contains barley malt.,0
Kentucky black sauce is the only recipe I use that includes Worcestershire,2
As another poster noted L&Ps is gf (at least in the U.S.),2
"I’ve also never used malt vinegar. 

I figure of all the substitutes we have to contend with, homemade bbq sauces are among the least inconvenient",2
Oh! Sorry for the misinterpretation! I hope you make muffs asap! 🧡,2
I was going to ask about this because the dry-ness emphasized by OP made me think about pasta con le sarde but the ingredients are totally different 😅,0
"99.9% of all BBQ sauce is GF, it's ketchup base with ACV, mustard, seasoning etc.",2
"Thanks and yes,
I meant ouchies for OP for spending $45 (unless,
Of course, they just really desired to own a physical copy, I am that way with certain things!)",1
I never through this post would ever blow up to what it is today,2
But I knew this recipe was gold,0
I’m really glad you enjoyed it!,1

I've literally never seen that.,0
Can you plsssss share the recipe??? It would be sooo amazing to try,1
Thanks!,1
Try some Pickling spice,0
"My mom makes something similar, we are from Serbia so lots of our dishes come from Austro-Hungarian cuisine",1
"There's two contenders I can think of here, one is like pörkölt but with cubes of beef instead of pork, or a mix of the two meats",0
Quite a dry pasta topping,2
"The other is with ground beef, can also have ground pork added but not necessary.


The main ingredients as you said in both dishes are onion, paprika, bell peppers (optional), tomatoes, salt, pepper, parsley",1
I have one of the recipes translated to English so if you like I can send you a pm,0
"The other with the ground beef is not in English, but I can translate that too if you're interested. 


I don't know if these are the sauces you're looking for, but they're super tasty in any case.",1
Yes and if you buy commercially prepared bbq sauce it is made with regular Worcestershire sauce and I was replying the comment that listed Worcestershire sauce as a gluten free ingredient,1
Ouchies lol,1
I want this rhubarb muffin recipe now,0

"This is precisely what I do in a standing mixer, although I don't add butter",1
It is so simple and the best better ever.,1

#The Big Bad Wolf's Brownies
##What you need:
Shortening (for greasing baking pan)    
½ cup butter or margarine    
2 squares (2 ounces) unsweetened chocolate    
1 cup sugar    
½ cup unsifted all-purpose flour    
1 teaspoon baking powder    
1 teaspoon vanilla extract    
½ cup pecan or walnut pieces, raisins or salted peanuts    
2 eggs

##What you do with it:
1",2
Preheat oven to 350°,0
"Grease a 9x9x2-inch baking pan with shortening.
2",0
Melt the butter and chocolate in a large saucepan over low heat,1
"Remove the saucepan from the heat.
3",0
"Stir in the sugar, flour, baking powder, vanilla and nuts",0
"Add the eggs and beat well with an egg beater.
4",0
Pour the batter into the baking pan,0
"Bake for 30 minutes.
5",0
Remove the pan from the oven and place it on a rack,0
"When the brownies are cool, cut them into squares.

Makes about 16 brownies.",1
"Oh my gosh! I still have this cookbook from when I was a kid!!!

Edited to add, it's the Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse Cookbook",0
you'll need to be a bit more specific here,1
nearly every culture has some variant on meat+sauce+fire and 'bbq sauce' can mean many different things,1
"what color was it? do you know any of the ingredients? what did it taste like - sour, sweet, savory, etc?",1
My goodness..,0
What book is this from?? That's the same recipe I remember seeing my grandma use!,0
I had never considered an alternative for the fats,0
Will have to experiment and see how it turns out,0
I might try this with lard and coconut oil..,0
"Trying to think of better fat alternatives, this seems like allot lol",1
Churning,0
Churning would be an old recipe.,1
Yea that’s a fair point,1
I’ve fermented whole anchovies and onions and made a garum which was gf and very close,1
You don’t need koji/aspergilus if you use pig pancreas powder or whole fish with guts,1
Might have a look at Mayonnaise Chocolate cake,0
"I know, it sounds disgusting...it's  not",2
You want a mild flavored mayo - so no Hellmans.,1
It's not impossible to make home made Worcestershire sauce,1
I was just explaining where the gluten came from.,0
"as someone with celiac who grew up in the South and now lives in Hawai'i, no it unfortunately is not",2
lots of bbq sauces use shoyu in particular.,1
But in fairness that’s a valid reason along with dubbya sauce so I do stand corrected,0
I always use my grandfathers base,2
"Apple cider vinegar then equal parts slow roasted whole onion, tomatoes and stone fruits or apples",1
Malt vinegar...,0
That sounds like it could be a chocolate version of something like [Seven Minute Icing](https://mycountrytable.com/seven-minute-frosting/),0
I know I've had some similar older cooked meringue-type chocolate icings,1
"They do have a very distinctive fluffy texture, and develop a little harder surface pretty quickly",1
"But, I'm not finding much with some quick searching, and I'm not sure exactly what would be the best step to add in some cocoa",1
"Sift it in once it's mostly whipped, I would guess",1
The extra cocoa might mess with the consistency added earlier,2
You really wouldn't want the fat in melted chocolate with the egg whites.,1
"I'm going to try coconut oil (has worked perfectly instead of crisco  in other recipes, for me)",1
"Many barbecue sauces use Worcestershire sauce in the recipe and unless you specifically buy gluten free Worcestershire sauce and make it yourself, barbecue sauce is not always gluten free",1
Worcestershire sauce is not gluten free,1
Oh my goodness! My grandma used to make these(& now my dad also does at holiday's!) She used to call them Icebox Cookies/Junk cookies tho,0
So cool to see them elsewhere! 😊,1
😍,0
"Even without the salt, it's butter.",0
Totally agree as someone born in Memphis who visits family in Memphis and eats bbq there each time!,0
"No bbq sauce should have flour in it, wtf",2
"It's literally ketchup, vinegar, brown sugar, salt, pepper, vinegar, worchestershire, spices",0
"With some variations, to taste.",0
"My mom, sister and I are all gluten free",1
I thought the same,0
"My mom was watching food network and on that episode they dumped a bunch of flour in their bbq sauce! I always ask now!

ETA also some times it’s in there in like soy sauce, beer, etc",0
So that’s why the wolf was after the pigs—they stole all the brownies!,0
"My stepmom called it Wacky Cake and it was my favorite, so moist she didn't even need to put frosting on it, just a sprinkle of powdered sugar.

It was one of the first things I made to share with my coworkers when I grew up cause it's so cheap and easy to make and surprisingly good for its humble ingredients.

Those assholes couldn't handle the fact that it had no frosting, called it ""Cajun Cake"" because it was ""so dark it looked burnt,"" and refused to eat any.",1

"RemindMe! May 21, 2028",0
Performance in baking is also a reason.,1
Crisco is preferred by many for pie crust because it has a higher melting point than other types of fat,1
It also yields fluffier baked goods,0
"Contrary to popular belief, there’s no trans fats in crisco",1
Lard performs like crisco but is pig fat and very high in saturated fats,1
"Butter melts at a lower temperature than either of the above and like regular oil, yields heavier, denser products",0
"Source: stupid expensive, essentially useless, culinary education",2
You could have just typed in whip some cream beyond stiff peaks till it breaks,2
Take the yellow clumps and rinse with water till the water runs clear,1
Salt and there you have it: Butter.,0
All bbq sauce is gluten free,1
"To be honest I’ve never put gluten in bbq sauce, what reason would you have for using it?",1
"This would be my guess as well, truly the best chocolate cake out there IMO!

https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/7475/crazy-cake/",1
Maybe the depression era “Crazy cake”? It’s very dense and moist,2
You can find recipes if you search that name,0
I forgot to add that I double everything and it comes out perfect....if you want a larger size that is,1
In the article and in the top comment of this post.,1
