The restriction made sense to be able to help Ukraine while trying not to escalate the war to directly involve the nations assisting them,1

Allowing strikes on Russian soil using NATO nation weapons still has a huge risk of escalation and spiraling out of control",1

Power absolutely corrupts but it’s my personal belief that anti social personality disorder-people have been the bane of human existence from the very beginning,1
They feel zero empathy or human emotion far before they realize any position of power (and they often do come into power because they don’t give a single fuck about anyone but themselves.) They are incredibly good at mimicking human emotion,1

Easier said than done.  Would a no fly zone be established over Russian occupied territory where they're being released from?  If so that means destroying every Russian AA target on the ground to establish air superiority.  That means thousands of Russian troops killed directly by NATO who may as well declare war on Russia if it goes that far.,1
"Right but once that door is opened, who knows what could happen?",1
Waste of Ukrainian long range munitions,2
They need to reserve those for large critical targets like the hard to replace and static early warning radar systems,1
These drones are tiny which means the machinery to produce them aren't that much bigger,2
"You could probably fit all of it in a building no larger than a McDonalds, making it hard to target or guarantee a critical hit, and which also means the equipment itself probably isnt all that expensive to replace",2
Ukraine needs to save its long range munitions for critical very hard to replace assets,2
If this factory was destroyed Russia could probably order a new set of replacement machines delivered the next day from China.,1

"Oh please, you people are a joke",0
"Yeah, let’s listen to what an Isreali propaganda outlet has to say, one that benefits from downplaying all the negative reporting",2
The article offers absolutely no evidence of anything,1
"In your own propaganda piece: 

“New York Times correspondent Jodi Rudoren disputed and criticized the FPA statement: “‘Every reporter I’ve met who was in Gaza during war says this Israeli/now FPA narrative of Hamas harassment is nonsense,’ Rudoren tweeted, referring to Israeli accusations that Hamas pressure on foreign reporters had helped massage the messages coming out of Gaza in the last month.” And he said Rudoren’s Tweet “was followed by a furious email exchange with the FPA, in which Rudoren denounced the statement as ‘dangerous.'”

It’s always ironic that you guys always share your sources straight from an Isreali propaganda outlet, as if they don’t benefit from downplaying the negative reporting and coverage they’re receiving",1
"What evidence did they offer in the article besides heresay? 

Also, even if true, why does Israel murder American journalists? Ones that are also reporting facts of what’s going on, facts that coincidentally paint Israel negatively?

Let me explain to you the Israel narrative that they want us to follow and adhere to:

“The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears",1

In short, they judged that if they waited to gather the necessary ground forces, prepare them, and transport them to the location (either by ground or by helicopter), it is very likely that Hamas would have fled and escaped at the first sign of approach",2

Here’s a summary of some of the latest developments in this field:

**In a groundbreaking development**, scientists at Baylor College of Medicine have secured a patent for a gene that significantly boosts plant resilience to heat stress, a timely innovation as global temperatures continue to rise",1
"This genetic breakthrough promises to sustain crop yields even as conditions grow harsher, with the potential to maintain full production levels despite temperature increases that would typically halve the output of essential crops like wheat",1
"The patented gene represents a quantum leap in agricultural biotechnology, offering a rapid solution to the slow process of traditional breeding, which often spans decades to produce heat-tolerant varieties.

**Revolutionizing the agricultural landscape**, the advent of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing tools marks a new era of precision in crop development",2
"By enabling exact genetic alterations linked to heat resistance, this technology accelerates the breeding process, outpacing conventional methods in both speed and efficiency",1
"Additionally, synthetic biology is being harnessed to reengineer plant root systems, enhancing their ability to absorb nutrients and water, thereby fortifying them against the vicissitudes of climate change",0
"These pioneering techniques are not just pivotal for upholding agricultural productivity amid escalating global temperatures but are also vital for securing the food supply for burgeoning populations worldwide.

>Drone debris fell on energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northwestern region of Rivne, governor Oleksandr Koval said on Telegram",2
"The attack triggered a defence mechanism that cut power to some localities, although it has since been restored.

"> fossil fuel production is increasing as ever

Fossil fuel consumption isn't though",0
"It was still slightly increasing, but not ""as ever""",2
Since 2018 there has been only very little growth of fossil fuels in the [global primary energy consumption](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/energy-consumption-by-source-and-country?stackMode=absolute): In 2022 the fossil fuel consumption was 1680 TWh or 1.24% higher than in 2018,1
Compared to a growth of 6786 TWh (5.27%) between 2014 and 2018,0
"Over the previous crisis, when emissions fell in 2009, the growth between 2007 and 2011 was 7068 TWh (6.02%).

If you consider ten year periods, 2012-2022 fossil fuel consumption grew by 10897 TWh or 8.63%, while between 2002 and 2012 it grew by 28670 TWh or 29.35%.

Quite clearly the growth in fossil consumption has slowed down and isn't increasing as ever",2
The increase in 2022 over 2021 was 0.48%,0
We *are* approaching stagnation and decreasing fossil fuel consumption,0
And there are clear inflection points visible around the crises,1
"It also is reflected in the [global per-capita CO2 emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/co2?time=1850..latest&facet=none&country=~OWID_WRL&hideControls=false&Gas+or+Warming=CO%E2%82%82&Accounting=Production-based&Fuel+or+Land+Use+Change=All+fossil+emissions&Count=Per+capita), which peaked in 2012 and has fallen since from 4.9 tons to 4.7 tons.

>What has changed a lot is the way emissions are calculated (they're not measured anyway), mostly by carbon offsetting that's not working in reality.

I don't think that carbon offsets are considered in the carbon emissions data from the [Global Carbon Budget](https://globalcarbonbudget.org/) project and also not in the linked analysis on Chinas emissions.
