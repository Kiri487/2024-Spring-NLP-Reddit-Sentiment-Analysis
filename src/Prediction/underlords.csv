nice work!,1
Do you often take Jull for Zoo builds? Rank the Underlords from most used to least,2
"Mine is Anessix, Jull, Enno, Hobgen",0
"Congrats, did it with my favourite build too, 3 star Legion knight is op",0
Im top 100 of you want to party,1
Thanks,1
Gratz! Time to meme!,0
"Never seen the older ones, I got into the game late",2
"Very cool, OP!",1
Aiight mate,0
I also did not know hahah,1
"Jeez, there’s still so much I don’t know",1
No wonder I’m not high ranked,2
Thanks for the replies.,1
The cyan color on the damage bars are magic damage.,1
I thought their triple attack was physical damage? And what about Warriors to give them time for more triple attacks?,1
Isn't most of the damage a strong spirit build does magic? Why would you want anything other than Mages?,1
Rank the top 3 alliances to go with Spirits,2
"Mage, Warrior, Assassin? What about Swordsman or Knight?",0
"Wtfffff I never knew either, LOWS for a long ass time hahaha",2
Good job dude,1
Can you tell me the meta to spam yo LoWS..im stuck in big boss,0
Stuck in big boss..can you guys tell me which alliance to spam to get to LoWS,0
Thanks for keeping the dream alive! Maybe someday Valve will wise up and re-update this game 😁,1
Well done!,0
Welcome to LoWS! Im ranked top 100,1
Want to party?,0

"Hey there,
Shoutout to my boy “wuhek” on twitch (https://twitch.tv/wuhek)",0
"I used to constantly watch him, and judging by his latest vod being available from 3 days ago, he seems to still be up and streaming UL.
He speaks Russian for most of the stream, but will engage and answer readily, if you ask him anything in chat",1
"His game knowledge is seriously insane.

As far as I could tell he’s got a sunny personality, laughs a lot, and used to play everything on a top 10 leaderboard level",2
"By that I mean, this guy is so good at the game, that he could make every playstyle work really really well",1
"he can play “good stuff+economy”, “early rolling 3*”, to “alliances+high level” compositions pretty much perfectly",1
"He was so freaking consistent, that if 7 other guys in his lobby were playing meta stuff, his opponents had to *still* get seriously lucky (e.g",1
barricades & other contraptions + dusa kadens blade abuse) to hold their own,1
"Otherwise, wuhek’s gonna screw up your barricade comp with a handful of cranky alliance comps and double non-mage KOTLs with two mana items in the back.

It’s hard to describe *how good* he is, if you’re not familiar with a lot of the terminology",1
"My active days in this game are long gone, but the game hasn’t been patched in forever, so I’d be surprised, if what used to be good 1,5 years ago wouldn’t be good now",2
"If you have any direct questions to my post, feel free to ask.

Otherwise, just watch this guys channel, and learn",1
"If you want to engage, tell him “CallMeAFreak” suggested his channel",0

There hasn't been updates for about 4 years now I believe,0
"But the game still has players and you can still find games, thanks to the fact that the current units are all (fairly) well balanced",2
"If you've never played I still highly recommend giving it a try, plenty of fun even if there's no updates",1
What happened to underlords? I just discovered it after Riot killed League of Legends on Linux so I need a new autobattler,2
Is underlords no longer under development?,0
"No worries, my friend",0
Glad you got it sorted,1
Here’s to playing a dead game,2
;),0
"I do? I play for fun, and try to avoid anything that looks like work :)",1
Who plays casual??,2
I wonder if Lifestealer benefits from the healing bonuses? I don't really know :D,2
I like the random Lifestealer to round out your team,2
Couldn’t have done it without him 👍,0
"nah, its not updated anymore lad",0
You have to play the campaign to use the legacy alliances,0
"Thank you, haven't noticed your comment",0
I did the same thing and found the way to solve it,0
Knockout I guess,0
Standard takes too long and we working class jst cant,2
Level 7 I guess?,0

"watch high ranked streamers on Twitch

Also when I was new to the game, and for a long time, I kept checking my lobby mmr and always had an eye on the high ranked player if there was any (like 17k+)",2

"I know, I would be willing to pay if they continued development.",1

They had a real gem here.,1
I would also love to know :D,1
This game is alive?,2
It's always a toss up but man do I wish people played duos,0
"ya never takes more than a min or so to find a game, still fun",1
I only play when I have no data and am taking a shit somewhere without wifi,2
I miss the game for real though,2

What the fuck I didn't know I was subbed to this,2
4 real? underlords sucked ass from the beginning and looked like sht as well,1
tfts design is far more appealing imo,1

I’m sayin lol,1
What rank are you? Big boss or boss?,2
"Watch youtube videos of high lords, its pretty easy to get to lord once you know the meta and hidden techniques",1
Had trouble sleeping so I went up 04.30 and around 06 I fired up my first Underlords game in a year and got a game after apx,2
"3 mins~
Ranked standard",0
Ranked standard is pretty consistent for me,1
I used to be able to get duos ques sometimes but it seems harder now.,1
"Oof, I guess we can only play on pc that sucks",2
Game still alive?,2
"Agreed, had a perfect game with this strat the other day :) [https://postimg.cc/XXKHJ7K9](https://postimg.cc/XXKHJ7K9)",1
standard takes 5 sec to 3 minutes..,0
It's not random it's fast.,1
standard and KO you will find games quickly any time of day,1
For now i only play on knockout mode,0
"i mean i havent tried for probably a year but last time i tried, the first one was instant then after that we just couldnt find one",2
U can find duo matches?? How,0
Same reason why i am here.,0

duos sometimes takes very very long

ranked standard is pretty random",2

My Luna usually carries for most of the game until Slark gets tanky enough.,2
Slark 💀,0
"In knock out, it’s one of the most frustrating builds",2
Very little stuns.,2
Did they finally update it?,0
My wife and i play it too,0

I have a feeling I should leave it there or else I’ll get obsessed over it… maybe just one more game…",2
"You might be better off asking in a sub for your region, to find out how other iPhone users usually go about downloading stuff that’s not available in their region",2
I imagine it’s not a very common problem for those of us who still play the game.,2
I didn’t realise they were doing leaderboards in Underlords too,0
"Clearly I’m too low to find out.🙈 still stuck at Big Boss for Standard anyway, and I rarely play Knockouts these days",1

Hello person still joined to the Underlords subreddit :D,0

"actually yeah, you can find ranked standard and KO games in less than a minute any time of day",2

That did it for me,0

This game is still alive? Used to be addicted with UD,2
"Meanwhile, windranger and Drow in the background doing all the hard work",2

Look at what they did to my boy!,0
I’ll message you - check inbox,0
Any luck?,0
Okay right on,1
Maybe I’ll give it a shot,0
"The advantage is a few of your units are usually not in high demand like 
Venomancer / slader / alchemist and even if they are, you can make do with then being level 2 because you want the venomancer ability to stack poison and slader is just there for magic defense buffs",1
"His ability to debuff armor also can be very useful for burst damage but if he is killed, you can do without him

[Comp1 ](https://ibb.co/hL381VR)

[comp 2](https://ibb.co/C5NDspg)

About four units can be swapped with other units that still complete the alliances

Edit: This comp does extremely well with eight units so you only level up units once you are at eight and forget increasing units

Dangerous but rewarding: you can also decide to lose your first 4 rounds without units, you get a free spin for each of those turns and it makes leveling up faster",1
It's better to keep winning or losing at the the start than win lose win lose.,1
I’m tracking - that’s a good idea,1
How do you play with people competing in the build? Do you ever get out of it or always focus on level?,0
"Here is the deal;
The units that help you stack poison are squishy but if protected can do a lot of damage like venomancer, dazzle and your trolls too.

When properly placed, Jules will tank long enough for them to be effective",1
"If you put the 30% magic damage reduction on a unit next to jules,  he will mostly always survive until the end of the round",1
"Look for the Brute Hat, place it on venomancer or dazzle or both if you are luck to get 2",0
This means that every attack from those units will debuf damage and attack speed,0
"Since brutes change target to non debuffed units, you get to spread poison amongst almost all units which is what eno would do for you.",0
Just curious why not enno with poison stacks?,2
"Use poison, brute, trolls, magic resistance and jules",1
I promise you Lord in a month.,0
Uhm,0
I was once in your situation,0
Then I found Gwent,0
It was the only game that cured my underlords itch,2
Its also in maintenance mode but there is so much to enjoy as a new player,1
"Underlords is a good game but without updates, it's definitely going to die.

The craziest part is there are tons of alliances and units that are locked behind the last updates",2
I wish they just unlocked it all,0
"When in doubt, reinstall",0

Run windowed mode,0

"Kunkka, Spirit Breaker, Tide.",0
thank you,0
thank you,0
"With fire, stops their regeneration",0
I keep checking if anyone is doing troll alliance,0
"In that case, I use poisoners, qop, dazzle, alche, etc along with summoners",0
It works somehow.,0
Bro the game is dead already and closed by valve 🙂,2
The same thing is keeping TFT successful even if it's not as fun to play as underlords : new sets Quarterly,1
"True, some games you'll just get unlucky and have no chance to win",1
But there's a certain balancing strategy to Knockout which makes it possible to win pretty consistently and it's very fun,1
I also have a lord rank in Standard but haven't played it in a while.,2
"Knockouts are too RNG based for me, kinda stopped playing them after LoTWS, playing them casual often though ..",2

"Alchemist and Spirit Breaker should be on the right side, closer to the center, tanking",1
"Lycan shouldn't be the corner piece, he will die too early.
3",1
Dazzle should have moved closer to the tanks,0
"Don't keep 3* Dazzle in the back, his passive gives a few seconds of not-dying for surrounding heroes, so he should stand right behind the tanks in the front",2
"Theoretically could even put Dazzle on the front row between other tanks.
4",2
Building Ember Spirit instead of Bounty Hunter would be 2x better even though you'd lose an alliance.,1
18 copies of tier 3 heroes,0
In knockout you only need 4 to get a 3*,0
4x4 = 16 out of 18,0
"After checking the leaderboards again, apparently I'm top 38 now! Maybe it's time to start playing Standard...",1
Please update My Joy,1
oohh is a good idea,1
I miss all the old alliances,1
I really wish all alliances would be added back into the game and at the start of matches there would be something like a pick phase where alliances that were going to be available in that match could be picked and/or banned.,1
They were replaced with current pieces in the Town Crawl mode,0
I miss warlocks so much,1
you can do so in pve at least? the white spire missions still use them all,2
i dont know of any way to do so vs other players though,2

"* Optional Hero Pool in any offline game mode - Seasonal, All Heroes or Selected (enable/disable whoever you want) and Banned Only.
* Automated Hero Rotation - base it on series of comps or on banning certain alliances",2
"Weekly or monthly, though I'd prefer they rotate alliances weekly and hero pools more like monthly or quarterly",1
"* Replay/review City Crawl Victories - view your previous City Crawl performances, so you can learn from (or just redo) them next time around, rather than re-work it out a year later when you come back to playing again",2
"* Optional Fights in the Crawl - for all the locked hard battles, an option of the challenge (as it is now) or to win a full, online or XP hard bot game using X heroes/Y alliances/Z items",2
You can pick whichever one is harder,2
* Infinite rewards from the Battle Pass - XP is useless,2
"The BP currently does not give you any way to get *all* possible items in the game - with enough play, it should",2
"That, or set up a procedural, rolling BP every quarter (when the hero pool rotates) that basically resets progress and gives up new rewards",1
"**Make this BP buyable with in-game currency you can earn for free - if you're not going to put effort into the game, we shouldn't have to pay for it.**
* **Mod Support -** **I have thought of six thousand things I'd want to do in this game",2
"Pull a TF2 - open it up to the workshop, let us install our own workshop content/mods, and let the community keep this game alive, like so many other Valve titles.** 
* Full 'Legacy' Game Mode Support - have an open option for the old pre-Underlords game mode, and legacy game modes (if there are any others!)",2
"Perhaps a rolling playlist, A-la Apex legends) - this could even be a public queue option, and of course, it should support offline bot play",0
* Full Offline Bot Games - Localhost bot matches,1
If Valve ever switch off the servers--which they could well do tomorrow if they so chose--at least allow local login and bot gameplay,2
"**Do not let this game die as so many others do,** by being at the whim of the latest invoice (or in Valve's case, internal cost breakdown) for sever hosting.

You're probably right,1
"I find that they can out heal almost all damage though because if you can get to lvl10 with full fallen and healers, you get all the normal heals from healers, you get the heals and respawn from fallen alliance and with 3* dazzle and vesture you just don't die",1
"Or you at least delay death long enough to kill the enemy first, throw in the Paladin sword for good measure.",1
"> I find fallen/healer to be solid, especially if you can get a 3* dazzle and vesture of the tyrant.

Really? Wouldn't a DPS lineup just shred them? I find healers are super strong at 1 star, moderately strong at 2 star, and only Omniknight is good at 3 star (because his heal is a damaging AOE nuke)",1
But I prefer Omni in my Poison-goodstuff build with Dazzle/Qop/Alch/Lycan/Spectre/Omni/ShadowShaman build,0

"I like to play around with different comps, sometimes I literally just choose 2 alliances at random and see what happens.

"I feel like if there were more alliances and they were randomly swapped in and out, the variability would be much much wider",1
"Not only because of how many more comps you could try but also because of all the different comps you would be playing against.

Sure,1
"What do you feel is stale about the game?

For me, I feel like there's two 'good' builds, level 10 Hunter-Heartless and level 7 Poison good stuff",1
Apparently Fallen Mages are good but I find them to be far less reliable than those two.,1
"Ah ok, thank you.

Funny how I'm still learning new things about the game after playing on and off for a few years already.

I really wish they would at least add all alliances into the game on random rotation so the game has more variety",2
I feel like that doesn't even need to be a big update for what would essentially be far more depth and playability.,1
"It's because Medusa with Kadens trumps every 3* strategy out there (even without hunter synergy, although obviously she is about twice as good with hunters)",1
"Really every well positioned ranged hero does, even a random utility unit like Shadow Shaman, but Medusa MELTS everything.

We'd all like a season 2 but we ain't getting it.,0
Are you asking about the community as a whole? Or about yourself? Your title and elaboration are asking two different questions,1
"There are absolutely other Autochess games that get more frequent updates, and if you're unsatisfied enough to where you want to play something better maintained, you should just do that.

Lack of support has never been a sure-fire deathnail, hell, you can still find a Heroes of the Storm match relatively quickly; that game has been on life-support for years",1
When a community loves a game enough they'll play it because it either gives them something they can't get anywhere else or their time investment is high enough to where starting over in a new game is not something most people are willing to do,2
There could be any number of reasons people decide to stay and your perceived flaws of the game don't detract from the enjoyment others can find.,2
"Tks , i can now.",0

Although the game IS in a good state I really did enjoy the alliances and meta of the early days with the mech alliances,1
Being able to play an earlier version might be too much to ask but I really did like the early days of under lords,1
"I like a lot insect and Warlock alliance, bring back",0
"A lot of the game’s UI is optimized for touch screens which I think would translate well to poking/pointing in VR and the core gameplay of picking up and putting down objects (in this case, heroes) is commonplace in VR and makes sense for Valve’s finger-tracking Index knuckles controllers",2
"Obviously, it wouldn’t be first choice if you want to play competitively and players would want a lot of other updates for the game first (not to mention updates for other Valve games like CS2) so I agree with u/d20diceman that it’s unrealistic at the moment.",2
This game in VR (in my opinion) would be so unnatural,2
What makes you say that?,0
Like most people i quit playing when they added the underlords,1
They should have just been like a small buff that you can pick,2
I get the appeal of having them on the board but everything just became too busy,1

Good to know it's not just me.,1
Yeah I entered LOWS recently and quickly found out it's pointless to keep playing the way the system is set up,1
Due to the game being abandoned there will always be more player below me than above,2
So I have to place 1st or 2nd in every match I play or I will go down in rank,2
With the RNG of the game that is close to imposable so continuing to play will just be a constant down slide.,2

"good luck to you buddy, you've certainly chosen a very specific niche :< i like this game too but do you have any interest in attracting an audience? theres gotta be a million other games with a higher playercount nowadays",1
"started playing again this game 3 days ago and it just amazes me that their are still active playerbase and the que times are not long, much shorter than Dota 2 game similar to how long you que for LOL normal match (I only play normal match too)",2
Got bored with my new main game Marvel Snap and quite enjoying the experience of Underlords rn,2
I played this game back in 2020 and once in a while for the past 3 years I try if there are still players playing the game in it did not fail,2
That is what so cool about this game and Valve as a whole gaming company developer to retain and still attract new players and old players to comeback to their games (good example of this is the tf2 and CS old games,1
"Heck even l4d2 game has players rn.

I think I'm gonna practice and will go to rank match eventually to experience the whole game as a whole (I didn't played rank back in 2020 I was hooked by Drodos Auto-chess game dragonest publisher version) hope that I will gain a plat rank",2
"Even just normal games it's hard already to achieve rank one I'm only getting 2nd or 3rd place and many loss too but that's part of playing auto-chess games.

I just wish that valve just put two or one guy in their workforce to be in charge of updating this game for atleast once or twice a year and a yearly new bp for fresh new skins",2
It still shocks me that in my lobby I get players who have 300+ level of bps and other they're players who I think bought the bp recently since they are only below 100 levels,2
(And if I give enough time playing this game I think I will buy the BP cause it's cheap in the first place),1
"No! Only valve I trust not these ""blockchain companies"" they can make their own game!",2
True,1
But they have gotten the occasional big fix and seasonal community content,0
They even saved it from the bots.,0
My blind ass didn't see it 🤦‍♂️,2
Just installed it in my phone,0
I still like it,0
Too bad it's in maintenance hell.,2
ask the tf2 plays that have been saying the same shit since 2017.,2
"You need to ""buy exp"" for 5 gold to upgrade your level and get to put more units on the field as well as better chances to find more expensive units",1
I am playing because I enjoy it,1
It's just funny to me that considering there are so many games that do get updates or balance changes that I keep choosing to play this one - even though it is unlikely to receive any more care from valve.,1
i play pretty much all games because i enjoy spending my free time playing them,1
"based on reddit comments though, playing things you like seems to be a rarity.",0
TFT is actually a fucking awesome game,1
dead game just like artifact,2
I played probably thousands of matches before finally getting Lord rank,2
I honestly didn't know if I'd keep playing after that or not,1
"Turns out, not.",0
"I love the auto battler genre but they doesn't scratch that itch the same way underlords do, i played tft since launch and at first it was outstanding but nowadays it's just filled with gimmicks that doesn't really feel autochess anymore 

The game is abandoned but very much playable, so i'll play it to my hearts content",1
Chess,0
It's because you're in here..,0
For the long haul,2
Thank you!,0
there are rumors that a Blockchain under XRP company will buy Underlords and make it play to earn prior to the upcoming Bull run,0
It’s always felt like a deck building game to me,2
Once I started approaching it as such I started wining consistently,1
"Yea, i agree with you",0
"Besides that i hate the visual style too.

  
I guess you can try ehh, Mechabellum, its sort of autochess",2
because Underlords is actually a good game but the lacks of updates and new contents are what killed the game.,2
my problem with TFT is its straying so far from what i enjoyed about autochess,1
they keep adding in all these random gimmicks and the headliners season felt more like a deck building game than autochess should,2
plus they usually break the balance at some point in a season and never quite get it back again,2
Teamfight tactics,0
LoL version of autochess,1
What’s TFT?,0
Yeah,0
I guess it just need marketing!,0
That’s a very nice reason,1
I like that I get to play with players i run into on daily basis in my lobbies,0
"I did this and it was hella worth it! Leagues universe is actually fun and amazing.

Dota 2 immortal player btw",1
Hahahah,0
TFT is the best followed by auto chess (android/iphone),1
maybe I'll have to give a shot..,0
but I prefer the Dota universe.,0
and not having to install Riot Vanguard to play an auto battler.,0
This game doesn't need updates.,2
TFT is amazing,1
TFT,0
"the best games ever made were ""abandoned"" and don't get fixes or updates.

i was going to say it has nothing to do with how good a game is, but it does",1
games that aren't getting updates are better.,1
"you know what is out there, why dont you play that? TFT ofc",0
I still enjoy my game of Underlords as visuals and the heroes speak to me more,1
"but not gonna lie, i rarely play anymore.",0
dont go with trends,0
just try both games,0
underlods is a better game less corny and mainstream,2
more chill to play,1
tft is a game filled with egocentric ppl who tryhard every game to prove some shit points,2
How do you have two accounts?,0
"gg, you always give me issues 😝😝",0
I really don’t think it’s notail,1
Same here just crasjed after open app on my s24 can anyone fix this?,0

This is really good,1
Ceep it up.,0
And then we come full circle :D,1
Come que with me (Wussel),0
best thing somone can do is custom mod of the game and update themselves on dota,1
This is really good and so is Tales And Tactics,1
It's lacking content and if they add more it might be better than Dota itself lol 😂 and it's pay to win in most times and it's so obvious.,1
Thanks for taking the time to explain! That makes sense and nice strategy,1

"I wouldn't consider anyone else but Jull with this build, since you have effectively ""3.5 tanks""",1

Life stealer is also not as tanky without coverage sometimes,0
Hence your positioning is quite questionable,2

"Overall a bunch of 3 stars is never a win guarantee, especially in KO",2
"And yes, Satanic goes to Slark.",0
"The main reason is so that she would be the first Demon in my crew to cast her ability, since I was targeting maximizing her damage specifically",1
"Since the blink gives her 60% mana she'll use her ability super early (and silence all the other Demons), to do her max damage asap",1
"Otherwise, theres a high probability that QoP or a melee Demon will reach 100% mana first and silence Spectre, in which case Spectre may be dead before shes un-silenced and able to use her ability.",1
Why is blink dagger good with Spectre?,1
"VR and AR are a bit different things, and in either you can still interact with things with various input methods.

The archer and golem/enthral.,0
That sounds very boring and nonsensical to me,2
Why put on VR Headset? You can't interact with anything.,0
Not giving your level 3 slark the life steal item was a mistake.,0
What does it mean?  So many tried to get me to play this after auto chess,1
Worth or nah?,1
I just go on these 1st - 3rd win streaks until BB V and then I’m the only non-Lord in the lobby for 10 straight games,1

Similar journey my guy,0
"What eventually worked for me was rolling for uncontested builds by checking the early rounds and projecting their builds based on their bench (Rouge +Assasin+Brute or Knights worked the best, HH and mage is usually highly contested)",1
Goofy builds like 6 savages + hyper carries or brawnies depending on your luck,1
Grunts and 6 fallens are pretty strong for level builds .,1
My old ass only has time to sneak in a couple of Standard games a day,1
Cracking Top 100 would be a good challenge tho!,1
I’ve been trying this for the past few months and I just can’t get over the hump,2
I have been in and out of big boss v at least 5 times.,2

may as well play digimon,0
"Yea I thought it was weird adding the ""underlords"" who are based on heroes but not actually heroes",2
"It felt unnecessary.

The game was already in a good place, all they had to do to keep it alive was swap different factions in and out to keep the meta fresh and maybe some additional balancing.",1
"its a great game, it should get more love and be popular",1
loved it on my phone and my pc,1
"I don't think the result was bad though? They already abandoned the game at that point, if they didn't bring this guy in, we'd be stuck in the previous patch and I'm not sure anyone would prefer it to the current one.

Or well..",2
"to be completely honest, I can't remember if I liked it more",1
Also Valve letting the community do the work is not exactly a new thing either.,2
"I have hopes, but I don't think so..",0
"Valve just doesn't give a fuck about their games, they are no longer in business of programming games, only selling then",2
No chance,0
after Artifact you'd have thought they'd learn their damned lesson involving 'streamers' in anything,0
Obviously not,2
"Valve, once great, now idiots",2
"They fucked the game sadly when they introduced the heroes + more, was already in a decent place then they over complicated it so new players were deterred.",2
I emailed Gaben and asked for an update,0
Didn’t hear back 😂,0
They already brought in some streamer to do the last patch before it was abandoned,0
Guess they don't wanna do it again.,0
Valve doesn't even support TF2,0
Underlords has no hope,0
Love this game when it went out,2

"I know he mentioned coming up with a proposal, but did valve actually respond to him? And did they respond with something that wasn’t just auto generated?",0
Sorry that's wrong,2
I played under lords on release and loved it but after they closed it I went to TFT in kinda season 7 and they do every set a great new addition,1
"It's a good game.

I know it sounds odd but you can like both, you don't always have to take sides",1
Not with the Valve we know.,0
"It'll never be able to outcompete TFT; waste of time and money unfortunately.

It'd require so much work to constantly update metas and make changes like when this game was first active.",2
I'd say the chances aren't literally 0% but it's a lot closer to that than 1%,1
"Baumi, the face behind stories of Dota, had his proposal to resurrect underlords turned down",2
He was incredibly passionate about it and did intensive research about the game.,2
relic arena is the update you're looking for,0

Nope,0
None.,0
You also get it,0
Style is important,1
"Nothing like being #1 at level 10 with 30 gold accumulating interest, your hair swaying in the wind, as you barely needed to lift a finger to secure the victory.",1
"Certainly a bit of luck, but you can improve your odds if you try to save up to 30 gold in order to get that +3 max interest bonus",1
Then only spend enough gold so that you stay above 30 for a lot of rounds,1
"This way, you maximize the number of times you can reroll your hero selection and therefore be more likely to get what you want.

The MORE lucky thing was that I got the item that says ""this hero is a Demon"", which put Spectres damage over the top.",1
How can you so lucky to have lvl 3 spectre 🥹,1
That really depends on your definition of alive,1
"The game still exists, you can still get matched into lobbies, but it's been the same meta for like 3 years now and the reason rating issues like this one happen is because so few people play they've gotta match you wildly with people of different ranks.",2
I loved dota Underlords so much,1
I have no idea why it was abandoned,0
Unfortunate :(,2
This was posted a month ago,0
Wait this game is still alive???,2

its on life support, and will be until the servers are shut off",0

"It really depends on what units other players are buying/building toward.

If you're lucky and no one is doing the particular build you're building toward, then you might get a bunch of 2 and then 3 stars later on.

There are different strats, some relying on particular 3 star units, others relying on alliance bonuses.

I've been posting a few videos of my wins, but the ones with a giant number of 3 stars, I basically build up to 37-38 gold, then keep rerolling while keeping my gold that high to get the units I want, to the star level I want (generally it's 3 star, but sometimes it's 2 star, etc).

Like for the rank 1 units, I'd keep 3 units until i'm 4/5 rank up, then spend everything trying to get more of those particular rank 1 units while the % chance to get them is highest",1
Same for rank 2 (at level 5),0
"Same for rank 3 (at level 7).

For when I need a rank 8, I usually get up to level 8 to get the occasional one, but don't depend on getting it 2 stared.

I generally very rarely have a build that needs level 9 or 10...usually not the strongest of builds (since generally you'll be lacking 3 star units).

Also, if you're bored, play around with this tool:

[https://underlords-university.vercel.app/teambuilder](https://underlords-university.vercel.app/teambuilder)

I like to experiment with some builds in there, then try them out in the game.",2
Oh weird I thought I'd tried that,2
"I'll give it a go, thanks",1
"I'm by no means a top player, I've hovered between 16-16.5k for what feels like forever",1
"But in my experience in high level lobbies, the winning builds almost never have 3 star units.

The randomness is just too variable in my opinion",1
"If you try a rolling build and aren't getting lucky, you start to lose a LOT of hp way too quickly, and then when you are done rolling, the other players have 3-4 more units on the board so you still lose the next bunch of rounds, which often eliminates you, or brings you close enough to zero that one loss will end it.

Of course there are outlier games where someone gets extremely lucky hyper rolling and ends up with 4-5 3 star units really early and they go on to win, but when it comes to the average game as a whole, I feel like its WAY easier to move up in mmr by never hitting the roll button until level 10",1
But that's just my two cents obviously.,0
It’s really great! The best autobattler I’ve played since Underlords was active.,1
You can complete it by playing against bots,1
The trick is to scroll down and choose Hard mode(XP) between the available bot difficulties.,1
"For knock out I would always go poison, summoner, brute and troll",0
And in that instance my best carry is usually meepo and alch,1
They do so well together for their sync,0
If I get a 3star Lycan and bara feed each other well too.,2
"Congratz on getting that high in Knockout! I've tried it but cannot get any satisfaction from playing in Knockout, too much RNG",1
"What did you use the most in Knockout, as a carry? Slark, Lycan, Spectre or Omni?",1
I was ranked 230 on standard,0
I do the counting of cards and I do exactly what you said and make a plan before I play,1
But last 5-6 games it’s been hard to get any 3star units,2
I also suck and have way fewer games played,0
"Try picking a # of guys u want and their alliances before the game starts, and then stick to that no matter the outcome or any other distractions",2
"Play that team like 5 games in a row, then try another",0
"Now that the usual brain usage is already accounted for, try focusing on maximizing your income",2
"Also, practice keeping an eye on your opponents pieces to build up your ""cars counting"" abilities",0
"After grinding out a few number&alliance options (and most likely losing), create another pre-game team comp, but now allow yourself to adapt on the fly",2
"Practice switches alliances/upgrading and completely switching your combo without sacrificing money and streaks.

I feel like ive been cursed with anti-3star luck since i have so many games where im the only one holding a hero and have many 2☆☆ and 2☆ from like round 10, and on round 40 not a single remaining hero comes and im out",1
So sometime i have to adapt and go 10 heros with no ☆☆☆ and sometimes come out on top,1
"Id suggest the obvious of going hunter combos, practicing different poision set ups, assassin/swordmen, just have fun with Legion Comander.

Being average in high elo isn't average,1
"The StS element is pretty light in this game - mainly the same kind of map progression.

It's a solid auto battler with a big roster and some interesting mechanics",1
"One thing to note is that even though units have tags, there are no bonus traits given by having multiple units with the same tag",0
So that strategic element is just not there,0
"There's some passive synergy by teaming units that do the same kinds of buffs and debuffs, but that's it.

It looks good, sounds good, and plays well",1
"Difficulty scales up pretty quickly and like any auto battler, they need to work on balancing",1
"But it's early access so hopefully there will be some fine tuning along with additional features.

Absolutely worth trying, since there's a free demo.",1
How long for a game? I'm looking for something 30 minutes or less.,2
Thanks! Gonna check it out,1
The steam reviews compare this game to Slay the Spire too,2

It's disheartening that the last update to this game was released almost three years ago.,2
indeed :(,0
"I always put my tanks at the back, and 1 on the side, and my range in the 3rd row, this prevents assassins from backstabbing, and at least 1 tank will reach the front line before the fight starts.",2
It's a pretty fun take on the genre,1
Just know that (at least in the pre-release) there aren't designated classes that grant team bonuses like in many other auto battlers,1
"Unit synergy is determined just by the kinds of buffs, debuffs, damage types, etc.",0
Fuck this furry Company pepehands,2
Nice one! I do miss this game I havent played for years but still frequent the sub,2
Take hearth in that Valve does usually get around to revive games eventually.,2
just wait for relic arena.,0
This might be the case in certain game types,2
"But live service games, and multiplayer competitive games need at least a small amount of updates for the game to stay alive",2
"The problem with valve is that they had 2 insanely successful games that make money for 10+ years, so now anything that isn't a huge success is considered a failure",1
They are only looking for games that are going to make them tons and tons of cash.,0

Other keyboard is voice keyboard which is not going to work well,2

I'm pretty sure thats the intended take away from the wolf round.,1
"you got me wrong, i meant hh owns assassins, and the part where they own is not really wk, is often they don't have any SB and so your dusa kaden or whatever is free to stay in the corner.",1
HH with brigade?? I don't think assassin counter them because 2 of assassin best hero is melee and even 3* ember can't cut deep enough into their backline,1
They will free hit you with tide stunning your hero and wk spawning his summon.,1
Assassin is an excellent matchup for HH..,1
but it's good you had fun :D,1
"Well, now I actually see",0
They use 4000 points difference in ratings to magnify the score ten times while using a ridiculously low K-factor,2
"I think I can see where they came from, but then the system should have been adjusted with the inflating number of Lords over time which obviously never happened because they abandoned the game completely",2

Queing in a bit leme see,0
Maybe in an attempt to control the pool?,0
why tho,0
Not finding players other than thousands below is fair enough,1
But in a proper ELO (or similar) system you actually wouldn't lose ANY points because it would be considered too random unless you play at least few games in a row against the same opponent(s),2
That's why I am just curious wtf did the developers use to calculate the points.,2
My guess is the matchmaking system can't find someone closer enough to your rank so they pair you up with someone several thousand below your mmr so the lose is big while the gain is low,2

The reason is that, once kaden blade is available, having healers won't do much without crowd control.

Of course there are exceptions, like win-streaking hard and heavily diminishing the opponent HP before they reach tier 4s and 5s + Kaden; 3 stars on multiple units ASAP does help achieve it.",1

IMO, the most reliable strong build is HH, while the most uncontested and pretty strong build is brute poisoners.

If possible, start every match with the Shaman alliance, then build what you need from there.

Check detailed info about this in that guide by dani, posted here.",1
Learn the build in the link above from S tier to B tier,0
Try to play at least each build 3 times,2

"It's ok you're very likely playing people that have been playing for years.

Tbh I started pretty late too so I'm also newb but hit Big Boss without going *too* deep lol

Depends what mode you play, at least in Knockout getting 3-star asap is usually pretty good",1
"Sorry for clunkiness as I'm rushing this as I have an essay due, anyone feel free to correct me or add

#Units

Getting an early 3-star on heroes like Slark, Terrorblade, Spectre etc can destroy enemies",2
Heroes like Shadow Shaman are real good especially at 3\* you can hex an enemy unit (or 2 of them with Refresher Orb),1
"Ember Spirit is also a great Spirit-Asassin, Puck/Luna/Storm Spirit/Keeper of the Light/Omniknight etc good magic, Meepo can be a real thorn,  and Lycan/Beastmaster/Alchemist can be savage too",1
"Units like Crystal Maiden can offer CC, Antimage to take their mana and prevent abilities being cast, Juggernaut can be spell immune while spinning etc.

Some units, in my experience at least (so take with a grain of salt) have been pretty poor outside some niche cases",2
"Like unless I need that specific ability or to finish off an alliance I ignore, such as Venomancer, Nature's Prophet, 

---

#Alliances

As for Alliances I like Assassin's if they're squishy/healers without CC, Mage can be strong with Trolls, Knights or Spirit (Champ+Spirit+Dragon+Knight unlocks some abilities but you need perfect pulls), I also like Savage & Summoner depending on the units, Trolls, Druids can be good early/mid",1
"Demons can be high damage, Heartless/Hunters also decent.

Brawny in my experience is not so good as a main Alliance in Knockout",1
Fallen can be ignored (outside the specific heroes),0
"Scaled/Brute/Rogue/Dragon etc can be used as a side alliance.

---

#Underlord

I don't really know 100% the best decision to make here, but depending on my team/plan I go:

* any Anessix with Terrorblade since it's +1 free demon and usually get a full-health swap on his ult.
 * but I avoid Enthrall Anessix if 1) I feel like I don't/won't have the burst damage, or 2) if the enemy is Druids/Summoners so I don't Enthrall a minion
* Jull when I need a tank
* Hobgen - I only go Friendly Fire Hobgen when available sometimes, with Mages for high magic damage.
* Enno - usually All Out Attack! Enno if I go Poisoners to reduce enemy attack speed.

---

#Positioning

also important but im trash at it so I can't really give much lol just keep in mind what they're playing, my problem is I clump up too much so I have to make sure to take note of AoE in how I spread out",1
"And take note of Assassin's in case they teleport behind, so I might build on back-line or put some tank(s) behind.

If you have the time under pressure, you could also see how they're positioned and change your units position on another side of the board if you want to focus on a higher priority target on that side or focus cc/silence/antimage on a specific unit first, etc.",2
"Just keep playing the game, I know it's probably because of unfair matchmaking due to small player pool.

But here's my catch 

Secure the strongest hero, which one is the strongest? Well you would know if you're playing a lot",2
"I personally see that the meta is quite good which means everyone can beat everyone, but I know some heroes can be used as a flex ((spectre)) to secure late game.

Secure 3-star! Some 3-stars ability are busted

That was it! 

My favourite comp is troll knight because it's stable, easy, and can be brought from early to late game, just be patient and it can be combined to any other comp you like

Hunter or assassins and then you need to get 3-stars as soon as possible, because it needs that nasty 3-star ability to perform.

Spirit mage is really strong and amazing, but pretty weak at early.

And the best of these 3 is you can build late game comp which is Void, you can buy spectre in mid game and then add one more void.

And you can also secure scaled if the enemy's playing mage.

And there's more good comp but I don't really like it that much for various reasons.

Dragon mage
4 brute
6 heartless
Healer-poisoner
Savage-summoner
Warriors

Busted heroes = alchemist, spectre, slark.

And lastly, always try to get a comp that everyone's not playing, then you can get boost of luck to get 3-stars and beat everyone else.

And for itemization, I don't really think you need to overthink it, just buy whatever you think will lift up your team.

And for the underlords is the same, (if you play on standard), just choose any that'd be useful for your current comp.

I'm still a noob too but hopefully it's useful.",1

My s23 works fine.,1
3 stars slark became some sort of a fetish while completely overrated,0
You can counter him with anything by putting your range heroes in front of the melee ones to block them from moving at the beginning of the battle so that your heroes don't spread and he can't kill them one by one,0
If you have sth like scythe of vice or 2* tide hunter to stop him for at least 3 seconds he just dissapears from the board lol,1
"Spectre is a bit more difficult, but here works the same principle",2
And if she is not supported by assasins you just put your weakest range hero in the opposite corner of your other heroes so she flies to him only to get destroyed after,2

[this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppccXBxAXXI) spam hunter heartless so you can try his build.,2
"Yea, MoM is the go-to item on slark generally imo",1
Even over other items like moonshard or satanic,2
"Slarks essence shift is a passive so it is unaffected by MoM silence and he still gets his leap even though he is silenced (not sure how that one works, unless it is technically considered part of essence shift and therefore also a passive)",2
"Slark with MoM and savage comp works well also.

Fallen is a great comp, if I want a win I just go full fallen or fallen/healer",1
Sometimes it feels underwhelming until fully maxed out though so you need WK to make it feel like it really works,1
Imo anyway,0
"With fallen/healers you can get 3 star dazzle which is very strong with fallen comp, you can also throw in vesture of the tyrant.",1
"wait, you can use MoM on slark? I thought his skill is quite useful so I wouldn't let him silenced",1
"I personally like playing demons with Spectre in the comp, his 3 star ability is amazing",1
"But yeah, I haven't found much success using it LOL.

I would probably say maybe Butterfly? because his positioning is little bit weird, and he needs to be transformed as fast as possible with the least amount of damage.

I'm a noob, too",1
"But, as I'm reading the wikis, I find that fallen is quite unique comp, I never really thought about it, maybe I should try to get 6 fallen next game.",2
"Fair, I can usually succeed with slark because you just give him MoM and he basically does the rest.

Is there an item that is particularly good on TB?

I have also not had a lot of success with demon comp in general",1
Most other comps are easy but demons allude me somehow,1

Good advice,1
I tried him without mana and he just dies,0
"No sunder/meta and at that point there's just no point in having him.

"I rarely play him but he's quite good.

I see him like slark/spectre that need to be 3 star to be useful, and he's strong and has decent damage

I rarely play him since I don't really like hunter/demon comp, and liking assassin/void/knight more",1

"first i suggest familiarizing yourself with the game´s jargon, a common issue among new players that ive noticed",2
Check out the how to play and glossary sections in the rulebook,0
"-Level refers to shop level and is equal to how many units you can put on the board.

-Tier of a unit is equal to how much gold it costs to buy.

-The glossary says ""rank"" but most people call it ""stars"".

>Example: Lifestealer is a tier 3 unit which at 3 stars is likely the most consistent unit in the game",1
"If you wish to roll for Lifestealer you have the best chance at level 7.

---

The reason why the underlords round is such a turning point is likely because of unit positiong",1
Abusing positioning is a huge thing in Underlords (ex: hiding units behind Jull or ranged heroes huddled in the corner behind barricades and annessix),2
"The underlords also usually make up for what your units are lacking.

Try putting your units on one side of the board, that way if youre facing someone with units in the opposite corner or in the middle you force your units to attack only the unit closest to them and they all gang up on it",2
"If you spread your units out throughout the board then while you can have stronger units that deal a ton of damage, their damage is split between the enemy´s units and so you dont kill anyone while your units die one-by-one",0
"Whether a unit has 100%hp or 10%hp it deals the same damage during the round and also the same damage at the end of round to your hp.

So killing the enemy´s units one-by-one is usually ideal",1
"Since even if you lose, you dont lose much hp because most of the enemy´s units have died",1
That is why the Vigilant alliance is so strong.,1
"yep, that changed",0
"I think it was a good change since people dont save up as much and experiment more.

If you decide to go all in youre not losing out on as much as you used to compared to the money hoarders.",1
"Anti-mage does massive damage with higher attack rate and I don't put him in a tanking position (off to the side where he's relatively more safe).

The Lifestealer is kind of a fluff tank for me, that also does good damage",1
"Positioning-wise, he keeps my Pudge in the back for the assassins to poke",1
"The Mask of Madness makes the Lifestealer tankier, and also do a good amount of damage.

Overall, I think Anti-Mage benefits more from Moon Shard's attack speed bonus because he also has a chance to benefit from the Hunter bonus as well as his 3-star effect (which adds a ton more damage with faster attack speed).",1
I returned to UL after more than a year,1
I remember it used to give 5 gold income from 50 gold banked,0
Is it not the case anymore? Is 3 gold from 30 banked the max default income in this patch?,0
Gjood job,0
why not swap items between Anti mage and Lifestealer? Just wondering,0
Try 4 Brute formation,0
That way you reduced the damage output of your opponents so much.,1
"Its literally a strategy to lose, on purpose, to gain monetary advantage.

And lots of strong mid/late-game compositions will have you suffer the first 10 - 15 rounds until they pick up",1
"At that point, you could be lucky and still be at 60 health, or unlucky to be at 20",1
"Your chances are still way better at that point than anyone that went either all in or for easy obtainable trash comps in the early game.

You'll figure it out eventually",1
Early starters are often early losers too.,1
"everything you need to know to get good is available in-game, no need to go outside of it",1
"I recommend reading the rulebook (in-game) thoroughly, which contains information about the units, alliances, and items",2
"With knowledge of those three things you can improvise your own strategies, that's the best way to learn",1
"Experiment from that base knowledge - you will have to put in the initial effort to study those three things, but you'll enjoy the game much more as you'll have an understanding of what's going on with the items, alliances and units",2
"Not only will learning be much faster but it will be more fun, as opposed to trying to copy strategies that someone else taught you, etc.

As you get better, you'll notice some builds may frequently win more than others",1
"With your knowledge of the alliances and units, you may be able to see why (certain alliances have great synergy with each other, eg: think savage alliance units gaining increased damage per hit, combined with trolls which give faster attack rate to all units, including your savage units, allowing them to build up their damage faster - that's one example of a nice synergy, but there's countless synergies like that!).

Besides that, here's three foundational things you'll need to know:
1) Have 10 or more unspent gold before the round begins to gain 1 bonus gold at the end of the round",1
"This increases to 2 bonus gold at 20 gold, and caps at 3 bonus gold at 30 gold (40 gold still only gives 3 bonus gold).
2) All units come from the same shared pool of heroes with every other player",2
As you get better you'll have more than 1 build you feel comfortable playing,1
You should try to go with the build that other players aren't picking,2
"If the units you want aren't being bought by other players, there's a much higher % chance you'll find them during rerolls.
3) Every time you win, you gain 1 bonus gold",1
"Every time you lose, you get a free reroll",1
"Which one is better? Neither, they're both situationally dependent, although you should generally prefer to win, as every time you lose your health will go down, and usually the bonus reroll just isn't worth it for that other than in the very early rounds",1
"Note: You notice you may get more and more bonus gold on a winning streak, the same applies to losing streaks, but this is of course more risky, as you're losing a lot of health on a losing streak.

Armed with this knowledge, go forth and conquer",1
Keep in mind that the people who lose rounds have an advantage over you which is the free rolls,1
They are more likely to get better units over the rounds that they lose,1
"This probably means better tier 2 / tier 3 units in the early game.

Your advantage over them is gold",2
"There are four ways you can leverage gold.

1",0
Have a bigger bench,0
"If you are open to more options for your units from your bench, you are more likely to hit 2\* units in general",1
Often it is better to stay on lower level (especially if you have lost your winstreak bonus) and keep random things on your bench,2
For example you might buy a random spectre even if it doesnt fit your comp at all,2
Maybe you get lucky and find 2\* spectre next turn which will carry your midgame,1
Or maybe you add a random 2\* tusk just because you can,2
"If you dont hit any of the bench stuff, they are easy to get rid of whenever you want.
2",1
"Be higher level, giving you access to tier 4 / tier 5 units earlier",1
"This is good for comps like poison (viper), hunter (mirana), savage (lone druid), and arguably mage (rubick + lina)",1
Tidehunter or doom will fit almost any comp,1
"Your power spike will happen when you manage to 2-star the tier 4 unit.
3",0
"Hard roll = commit to finding a 3\* unit once you are at a level where your comp can hard roll (can be anything between 4 and 7, depending on units)",2
Hard rolling means you will naturally fall behind because it takes a long time to hit 3\* on something,2
"Sometimes its not worth it, and other times it is",2
"It's not that easy to tell beforehand.
4",1
Soft roll = do 1 or 2 rolls because you are close to upgrading multiple units,1
"This is good in the short term (for example for extending winstreaks, or for avoiding death) but bad in the long term - if you just wait 3-4 rounds there is decent chance you will hit these units anyway, effectively wasting your gold.",1
Something else that people don't take into account is the lv of minions the lobby is holding can impact your chances of hitting those lv minions when rolling for 3 stars,0
You can do this yourself by holding the minions that are at the same lv as your desired minions to further increase odds.,0
"Get to the level that has the highest % chance for the tier hero you want, then keep your gold above 37'ish while rolling until you get 3-star of the thing you're looking for.

The first few rounds aren't really important in the long run.

Sometimes I don't spend anything, just go with whatever I get until I get 30 gold, then buy XP (while staying above 37 gold) until I'm the level where I want to get 2 or 3 star units...then I stay there and reroll until I get the levels I want.",1
Yeah i have a ton of gold and oftentimes the biggest level of all players i know about the shared pool of heroes its just that my level 2 pudge alch slardar etc cant really do much against level 3-4 lifestealers omniknights etc,1
Also its *always* the rounds after everyone picks an underlord is there something special about it? I feel like there is cause losing from 98 hp while there was a guy with 40 hp on round 9 who also outlived me is straight up crazy,1
"save gold to get interest (10 gold in the bank at the start of battle gives 1 extra at the end of battle, up to 3 with 30).

Look at what heroes other players are getting by checking the scoreboard often (press tab) and get something else so that you dont compete with them (there is a limited number of each hero in the pool).

Learn the strenghts of each underlords (just pick jull every game).

"Yes, to fix the Android build",0
there are some level builds you can force every game,2
if you're rolling it should be on what the game has given you in the first maybe 3-5 rounds,2
also pressing tab and seeing what everyone has helps a lot too,1
"say you have 3-4 units for roll mage, but press tab and see someone else already has 6",0
then it's not nearly as good an idea is it.,1
Play Knock-Out as it is a simplified version of Classic,1
I tend to go for an strong damage build such as Ember/Slark/Terrorblade to win the lategame.,1
You can do this in ”higher ranked” games,1
If there is like 2x level hunter players you can roll your units,0
There is 30x 1 cost and 20x 2cost units in pool so if couple peoples have 2star you still have alot of them left to buy,0
Ofc there is also games when its not option to roll them but you should be able to do it pretty often.,1
"Is this casual or ranked? Because in all your videos you seem to be uncontested on drow, windranger and a bunch of the heartless characters which is impossible in higher ranked games.",2
Sometimes I stopped playing some games because of changes to my favorite characters I played (like League of Legends),1
"It probably helped balance or something, but it was fun just doing dumb stuff with my characters (that I paid money for because of some specific thing that was fun, which was changed later)",2
Meh :I\~,0
I loved this game but the awful lack of new content and update made it stale for me,2
It's sad that Valve can devote an entire tournament for DOTA2 but not even update this game.,2
"No, you should have an idea of what build you want, and work toward it regardless of what units you get.

Keep an eye on what other players are building toward to decide if you want to keep pursuing your build or to abandon it and try a different route.

At 10, 20, and 30 gold, you get +1/2/3 interest (so most people try to save up at least 30 to max out how much gold they're getting each round).

Maybe to start, try building a team using something like this, and see if you can make something that looks fun and experiment.
https://underlords-university.vercel.app/teambuilder

At the start, don't worry if you're doing the best builds, and just enjoy the mistakes and learn what works and what doesn't.

A lot of people have good results by maxing out all of X/Y/Z alliance, and some alliances counter others, so could be a game of luck where your opponent is weak to you",1
Figuring stuff out and making the mistakes and learning from them is the fun part in my opinion.,1
Thank you for this,0
"The dictator of how you would play a game is the units available on the first rack, right?",1
you just have to play a lot,0
"there are nuanced things like  deciding when to level, what items to pick, when to sit back and basically lose streak on purpose",0
all of these vary depending on the comp you play,0

That's why I keep my anti-mage where he is,0
"He helps out with enemies that jump to the back line, then works his way to the front without taking much damage usually",2
"Also, he attacks from the very side where the tanks usually aren't.",2
My anti-mage always runs straight towards the enemy Jull.,1
Got it! Time to become a lord.,0
"Just keep an eye out if someone starts building up the same build, have at least one alternate to swing off to (preferably more with experience)...that's why I keep that Savage build in my back pocket, since most people don't ever build 6 Savage up.

Another fun build is 4 Healer + some tier 3 damage dealers (doesn't matter a ton which ones, because the healers will make them much more durable, and you can have fun choosing the ones no one else does).",1
"Thank you for the detailed guide, you might run into me now copying your build",1
Hope the servers stay up for a few more years.,1
This specific build I'm using is my current favorite (if other people aren't building into the same units),1
"It's a good mix of damage dealers and tanks, along with some anti-mage stuff",1
"For this specific build, I do either Vengeful Spirit or Shadow Demon for the Heartless (whichever one I can get more pieces of by the time I'm one xp before level 4).

..the technique I'm using is not leveling up my units at all, and saving my gold until 1 xp before level 4, then right when that buy round starts, I reroll to get as many tier 1/2 units as possible (mainly hoping for Anti-Mage > Windranger > Drow Ranger > Pudge > \[Shadow Demon or Vengeful Spirit\].

Priority after that would be Lifestealer, but not a high priority and can be sold for space",1
"After Lifestealer, last priority is Alchemist.

After I get to level 4, I usually let my gold get back up to 30+ and stay there",2
"I usually try to hold my gold at around 37/38 so I have enough to purchase stuff as needed without falling under 30.

If I get enough of my priority units to 3 star, I purchase XP to get to level 7 to fill out the rest of my build and get the 4 Heartless bonus (as well as 2 Rogue / 2 Brute that Alchemist brings at level 7).

Other than that, my unit formation is what you see in the video",2
I keep Pudge in the back as long as possible to play with any assassins (or Blink Dagger users) that like to tickle me down there,2
"The Anti-Mage sometimes helps out if he feels like it.

...so other than this build, my other favorite that no one really seems to do is 6 Savage + Luna (preferably with Moon Shard) + Slark (preferably Mask of Madness)...Savage's +13 damage each attack goes crazy with these if Luna or Slark stays alive long enough with their +Attack Speed items.

I post these videos exactly after I play a game, so pretty much random times whenever throughout the day lol...I'm not good at the game, mostly just a casual nerd :p",2
"No.

To me, it feels like a comfortable game of solitaire or minesweeper...you know the rules, you're getting old, you just wanna play the game without learning stuff, it's casual...",2

The current top scores are very similar to what they've been the past few years,2
"Unlike in standard, where the top scores have steadily been going up.

In knockout there will always be that terrible game in which nothing works and you end up losing a lot of points",2

Converting 4th and 3th to 2nd and 1st places is something you can learn",1
Perhaps you need to convert builds in the lategame or take more risks by playing greedily,1
Having a great positioning game can also help you salvage 5th place rather than 7th if things are not working out,1
"The same goes for learning to work with bad opening packs.

The points you get for 1st, 2nd or 3rd place vary quite a bit, but if you get a long winstreak  going, that'll get you very far",2

Wins will still generate you \~40 points even at the very top of the ladder,1
"(Weak lobbies offer a bit less, strong lobbies offer a bit more).

A 10 game win streak would net you \~400 points",1
"Moving you from rank 38 (15600) to (16000) rank 12.

Now winning 10 games in a row might seem like a crazy feat",2
But that's the type of thing that top players can do on a good day,1
"(Maybe hitting a few 2nd or 3rd places inbetween)

It will seem out of reach until you somehow get the hang of it",2
"I remember being rather startled as a I suddenly stumbled from \~300th place into 24th on the leaderboard off a 14 game winstreak over the span of two days.

And at the very top, every now and then you get two horrible games in a row or something  and you have to win another 8 games to make up for all the lost points",2
Sometimes stumbling yet again kicking you all the way out of top 100,1
"Until eventually, you hit another streak.

Keep at it and you might just hit that first long winstreak to give you the confidence to push all the way up.",1
you can try against hardcore (xp) bots too!,0
"This seems to be the most common suggestion, so I've given it some tries",1
"I get a 3-star Legion with Pike (or Moonshard) with 8+ alliances, including a few Demons and 4 Knights for low damage from the rest of the team, but I can't seem to break 10-15k damage on Legion before I either get wiped or win the round",1
"I suppose I need a brawny opponent, but no one plays it anymore!",0
"Hmm yes, I'll add Meepo to the list!",0
"Yeah Ember with battlefury is something I've tried, but it does rely on them going Brawny pretty much, against anything else I can only get to 15k before I either lose or kill everything",1
It seems a lot of these builds rely on a certain enemy composition that I almost never see anymore :(,1
How could you do that,0
"Lucked out and got 3\* beastmaster on the 2nd-3rd round, holy shit the dude had all the health, still got second though xD",2
"I am convinced without a touch of a doubt, sometimes elo doesnt let you get some cards.",0
I'm not playing that seriously but find myself struggling to go above 15300,2
"As you say, the win margin is so low and you lose a lot",1
"So it's kinda back and forth, but like I said, I'm just playing it very casually, trying funny comps etc",1
Not really doing the meta stuff too much,1
"After all that was kinda my motivation to reach spire in the first place, then I didn't have to try hard as much all the time",1
Spire in KO was much much easier than std though.,0
are you on lords though? otherwise it should be a bit easier since the amount you go up/down is fixed,1
I have been stuck on 5k for 1 year,0
"if I recall what I did was Ember spirit with demon circlet, if you add enough demons he can deal insane amounts of damage to tanks",2
It was deffo mattjestic Bro,0
That cunt ones owned me in Casual Game beein the last remaining Players throughout Repositioning,2
Pretty good player though and very Humble,1
Sadly duos is dead and it makes me very sad because it was truly the most fun I’ve had gaming in a long time,2
I haven't played Underlords for a long long time,2
Watching *The International* nowadays rewaken my dota affection and I played underlords 20hrs last week,0
I'm level 400 and just received this badge today :),0
Nice! That's in my wheelhouse! However I try to losestreak rounds 1-10 for the rerolls most every game,1
I guess I'll have to comit to the inconsistency I guess.,0
"Ahh I see, if I remember correctly i had all 2 stars hunters heartless  and trolls by round 8 and a win streak that got me a lot of gold",1
I'm just having fun hovering at rank 1000,2
What did you do to go for it? I imagine a shaman start is needed?,0
Tf you on about?,0
"Hey hey, yess! I was so close to losing one round vs Slark but i ended up going all the way",2
I am too 50 by rank so lobbies are tough,2
"It's rare now, I never got it when I was ranking up, now it's a lot harder in lord",1
I'd be impressed if you ran it ;),1
"not sure but it's some absurd amount of damage like 200k or 400k damage dealt in one game.

&#x200B;

Edit: by LC

&#x200B;

edit 2: i was totally wrong, its when you achieve 30k damage in one round by a unit

[did some digging and found this](https://www.reddit.com/r/underlords/comments/fayyln/need_some_help_on_the_stonehall_savior_achievement/)

and if i remember correctly, i did it with slark+mom",2
"Reequipped my Stonehall then :) 

Can you remind me what Stonehall was cant recall but I have it somehow",0
"Hello! I recently tried the Rogue Alliance, and my 3-star Meepo with Battle Fury equupped was able to reach around 30k damage.",1
"Stone hall saviour is a tad rarer I believe, than perfectionist",0
Creating a LC raid boss > Not taking damage in a standard game.,2
the only 2 streamers you'll see now are foster and wuhek,0
both great players.,1
Not that rare,1
"I will try to watch his/her vids in yt, thanks for this suggestion.",1
"It is mattjestic, thanks for your help",1
God bless!,0
"Yes, it's Mattjestic",0
Thank you for your help!,0
Was he the guy with the wild hair? What accusations?,1
I used to watch Mattjestic and Bebe so I would agree with the other responses mentioning them,2
Probably Mattjestic.,0
this is the right answer,1
I like his stuff too,0
"mano, pq vc postou nesse sub? kkkkkk",0
You are talking about bebe872 for sure,1
Swim? He disappeared off the face after allegations and all,0
"It's not worth it, you want Luna to survive and keep auto attacking.",2
"I like her if I get mask of madness, otherwise nah.",0
Mattjestic perhaps?,0
Woah that's an amazing idea!  I gotta try that,1
I don't normally go knights but that'd be worth it.,1
Alarming? It's honestly far more than I'd assumed there were.,1
"edit: Sorry meant Shaman* not Druids always mix them up

I haven't played in a few months (and I'm a newb) but I remember in knockouts just pumping out one of the following to get to Big Boss, especially the top 4",2
"Idk the meta just my observations:

* Luna / Knights+Mages (Puck, Crystal Maiden, Rubick/Keeper, with Luna/DK/Abaddon/Chaos/Omni)

* Slark + Ember Spirit (w/ either Templar/Phantom/QoP)

* Spectre + Terrorblade demons + whatever

* Shadow Shaman (Summoner/Troll - Dazzle, Meepo/Lycan/Lone Druid)

---

* Savage (Bristleback + Lycan etc) usually with Summoner or Shamans iirc

* Windranger/Hunters (hit or miss depends on comp, Drow sucks early)

* Shamans (prio Treant/Lone Druid/BM maybe Ench/Mag if i need, etc) with some savage or something, not great but pretty easy I think",2
"I don't really like Nature's Prophet though 

* Doom (Brute - w/ Alch/LS/SB in whichever comp really idk meta)

Brawny feels useless to me but might have it if I'm using BM/Bristle",2
"Jugger feels decent against mages/spellcasters and Snapfire if I need dragon and/or i have mdps boost.

I use Poison (w/ Enno) or Warrior (or some of the other alliances like Healer/Rogue as side bonuses) but idk how to use them properly",1
"Champ I use with Spirit if I can, or Ember Assassins",0
"Fallen I don't care about but I try to use it sometimes to meme around with, but 6\* is a dream :'(",0
Knights in general are great imo,1
Esp with a 3 star Luna or Omni knight,0
that's alarming..,0
wonder how does underlord's playerbase stack up to tft or hearthstone battlegrounds,0
"not when she gets jumped by assassins, or better, just a single assassin that she then decides to attack and every other unit is too far away for glaives to bounce to.

Bristleback for the same cost is way more reliable",1
She does do a lot of damage,1
"Sometimes speading out the damage makes a hard-to-see drawback that she lets the enemies cast really fast, but i'm with you on throwing her in as a random 1* up to level 5 just to do more damage",1
Spread damage can be deceiving against things like healers where you really need discrete big single target kills to prevent heals..,2
My favorite thing is having Luna hold armlet though...even a lvl 1 Luna with armlet does so much damage,1
"Yeah def good, it's fire too so it does 2-4% dmg after for a few seconds.",1
The one that hits 800 damage,0
I'm so happy there's still sickos like me playing this game,1
">What am I missing?

Oh snap",2
"I thought Wildwing were the one that has lifesteal alliance, it's that one",0
Breaking the alliance too soon would make there isn't enough damage to be done so it's a bit tricky.,2
"But even the lightning hammer or stun hammer are great, or heaven's halberd to disarm",1
"Summon thunderhide alpha, refresher, transform into pig, or really any tier 5 item.",1
What item do you recommend for him.,0
"Meepo 3 without an item, what a tragedy! ;p",0
"I think LC is the choice, but I would try TB cuz I like him",0
But facing a team of shamans or brawnies is almost a must,0
"Right, yeah, that's the theory..",1
just haven't got it to work in practice,0
"Ok, I've found one! Although I'm not sure what to do - I use a 3-star Lifestealer with support units but he dies during the evasion time :(  


What am I missing?",2
"I don't remember where exactly but I do remember every quadrant has one, so it doesn't really matter which direction you're pushing for.",2
"I meant for you to get stonehall savior, you need to get LC to deal 30k damage",0
One of the few ways is knights which she can outdamage other units,2
"Oh, you can do it in the PvE? Do you know where on the map this fight is?",0
"Hmm, I like it in theory, but I've tried Legion a few times and it feels similar to Luna and TB in that it feels too slow, so it's easy for other units to steal too much damage, and it's also inconsistent in that if LC gets stunned or controlled or picks a bad target she just does nothing",2
"It feels like it needs absolutely perfect conditions, which I haven't got yet!",1
"LC should be in a comp where she has highest damage, knights for example.",0
Use Lifestealer in one of those streetfight against Wildwings.,0
