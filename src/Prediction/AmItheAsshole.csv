I put that envelope in the vase on the gift table.

It was the only family wedding I ever played more than a song or two, and it really felt good to have my contribution as a professional be respected by someone so close.

"The latter is a daily task that needs to be performed within a certain time frame before the store gets too busy and the machine was low on charge at the time because it‚Äôd not been plugged in the night before by the other people who use it, so my window to do that before my shift was over was already small and the thought of doing something that could see to me failing to complete my routine was very stressful for me.

Because I was overwhelmed, and genuinely believed that she wanted me to somehow do two tasks at the same time,I literally told her ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be in two places at once because I can‚Äôt leave the scrubbing machine unattended.‚Äù Whilst sounding like I was about to break down in tears",1

""I am judging him",0
"And wondering where the hell I went wrong.""

I think this issue goes deeper than just the FF XIV stuff",2
You wouldn't be an asshole just for that,0
But I  would check if the way you've been treating and rewarding your children has not had some negative effect on him,2
Life is obviously different from him and he may have some emotions he isn't able to work through because of the way you show approval only for what seems like extreme accomplishments,2
"This fishing party matter is just a symptom of that.

Think of it this way",0
"Do you go out of your way to emphatize with your ""underachieving"" child? To learn what's important to him, and to understand how he feels about his family? Do you know what he wants to be? Does he talk to you about those things? Or are you just letting the chips fall where they may? Yes, you love your son but are you making an effort to show and celebrate that love in the way he understands? Or are you content to be operating this rewards system you seem to have going on with your family?

Also, he's 15! That's so young to be processing something like ""you have nothing worth celebrating,"" on the spectrum or not",1
Maybe try to reorient what you value,0
"And yes, be less judgmental.",2
"Okay 

1",1
Why do I need to text my parents,0
As you can see this was posted very early,1
And my parents go to work early too,1
So I texted them so it wouldn‚Äôt be a huge problem and stress for them while they are at work,1
"They likely will talk if not yell at my sister once they get off work.

I‚Äôm the younger brother,0

I gave them up because I really didn‚Äôt use them,1
I have Netflix on my phone and everything I really need on my phone,1
So I stopped using them for a while and they sat in my rooom taking up space,0
"So when my sister asked if she could use them since I wasn‚Äôt I said yes.

Hope this helps",0
You made a factually incorrect and sweeping generalization (btw those are almost always wrong,2
"I have made a comments or two like this and certainly been put in my place to consider that not everyone has the same experience).

I‚Äôm not splitting hairs, I‚Äôm stating that the sweeping generalization you‚Äôve made may apply in this single instance, but to extrapolate that to all moms is simply not valid.",2
ESH,0
"How old are you two?  This sounds like a quarrel between twelve year olds, not adult women.",1
I mean now it's just gonna seem like she's been inviting his behavior,2
She's unbelievably dumb for this,2
And in America it can be EXPENSIVE,2
You assume he hasn't had a checkup this year,0
"You assume he's got the money to just run to the doctor to ""make her feel better.""

Anxiety can give people the shits",1
That's not News,0
And it's hardly worth the copay because OP can't be bothered to Google and is quite literally full of herself trying to police someone's bathroom habits.,2
Being on the spectrum and hosting a party can actually be a major accomplishment,1
That is really difficult for a lot of folks,2
"I don‚Äôt think your TA for not celebrating the video game but I do think if you consider his every day struggles just to function like everyone else, you can find an achievement in there.",2
Oooh..,0
"it sounds so sinister, but I've probably been consuming too much horror/dystopian media lately üòÖ",2
"You honestly seem to have written him off because he is neurodivergent and cannot possibly achieve, with ease, in the same way and on the same timeline as the other kids",1
You admit he is the only neuro divergent kid in your family as a footnote you don't actually think has any bearing on this situation,0
Do you know him so little,2
Reading your replies you let him spend as minimum time on his play station as possible,0
"He is proud of achieving something in his favourite game, with his limited access time, that is hard to achieve and takes hours of dedication and focus and understanding of intricacies, just like being good at school or sport takes",1
Maybe instead of being offended at the medium he shines in and refusing to celebrate him until he finds a more acceptable way to fit in with your expectations engage with him and his game and find ways to help him expand on those skills and interests,1
You are his parent,0
So be a damn parent and SEE HIM,0

So, basically, me (16F) went to a graduation day for an English course I'm taking (English isn't my first language, me and 5 people from the course were invited to a pizzeria by our teacher to eat and get our diplomas)",1
"Some were dressed casually, some formally",2
There were 2 problems: I wore socks that were too thick and I wore a black purse with white shoes,2
"I had just gotten those white shoes, so I wanted to wear them for the first time and I like the purse cause of the way the chain is placed, so I can fidget with it when nervous or stressed",1
"I sent a picture to my grandma ( it was a group picture, so I was kinda zoomed out) because she likes receiving pictures and she told me off about the socks and told me I should've worn something more elegant",1
"Point taken, I mildly rolled my eyes cause who receives a picture and inspects someone's socks, but whatever (She didn't see me rolling them cause it was over the phone) 

Then my mom told me that I shouldn't have worn a black purse with white shoes",2
"I told her calmly, but firmly that it's all subjective and that I simply liked those more",1
"Again, for reference, there's a picture of my outfit",0
"She told me that I was stubborn and I kept not being receptive and telling her it's subjective and I liked it and, according to her own sayings, black and white went with everything and no one else cared and she called me stupid and said I looked like a clown",2
"This wasn't the first time she had done that (it was the second, the first was a month ago on her birthday when I wanted to wear a green blouse with blue trousers), so I yelled at her that she should stop insulting me over something so inconsequential and that she was horrible and went to my room (I know, I'm dramatic, you'd suffer horrible punishments if you said that to your parents back in the day, I get it)",2
"Then she called me and apologized for insulting me, but said I was too stubborn, so I told her ""okay, let me go now"" (in a fairly insolent tone)",2
"She also said I was being crazy and that I started it by being so stubborn and not receptive when she was just trying to give me advice and that I ""didn't drink all the intelligence of the world at 16"" (actual phrase in my language, wouldn't know to translate it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) She kept hugging me pretty strong, I could've gotten out if I wanted to, but not without effort, but she let me go eventually",1
"I then got into my room and audibly cried (not on purpose, but living room and my room are pretty close), and she told me I was being dramatic and to come back out when I've calmed down",2
"Mind you, not 15 minutes later, she was like ""come back out, I'm not gonna wait the whole day"", so I came back out and she apologized for insulting me and said it wasn't gonna happen again and asked me if I was gonna be this fussy the whole day.

Back in 2007 I started living with T and her two sons J 1.5 and C 4",1
"J's father lived on a different continent so while I had a good relationship with C, J and I really bonded",1
At one point T told me J was jealous that C got to see his father often and wanted to try calling me Dad,0
"We tried for a while but it felt unnatural and he just reverted back to calling me Sergumstrovigus.

We split up in 2010 and I vanished into India for 1.5 years",2
T let me see J a few times in 2013/2014 but then just went dark,2
"No explanation, refused to communicate",0
"In 2018 I contacted her out of the blue because a mutual ""friend"" was telling people T had obtained a restraining order against me and I asked her had she ever applied for one",0
"I actually expected her to hang up before telling me but she told me she never applied for same, we had a friendly conversation and agreed to meet for lunch.

A few days later she asked me if I wanted to see J again",1
Over the years I do things with J whenever I'm in his town,0
This year he came to visit me in North Finland for 1 week over school holidays,0
"We had a great time visiting an island when it was -28C walking on the frozen sea, barbecue in -20C, husky sledding, joy ride on an icebreaker, Santa village.

She wrote the paragraph below:

""He was quite upset with me for not having more contact with you ..",1
"well, not going into to much details, but at the time being I had my reasons, but I think the contact you established the past years I do support as he is older now",1
"So, yes, I think he would like to visit again and stay in contact ...""

I was infuriated by the phrase: ""well, not going into to much details, but at the time being I had my reasons""

To me that means she still maintains I was so abusive, aggressive, dangerous that she had to protect her child from me",2
"I genuinely thought she had realised her mistake in projecting our failed relationship onto her children

So I didn't answer her for 6 days then told her that sentence infuriated me",1
"She replied:

""I do find it mayor complicated to communicate with you.

Concerning my statement, I was open and honest about what was going on (at that moment! ...",1
"already talked and solved the issue with J, so it's not an issue anymore)...

I value honesty in communication.If honesty leads to old grudges and 2 weeks of silence, I'd rather obstain from communication with someone like that at all, too much negative trouble for my daily life.""

I know she wrote that paragraph because she wanted sympathy from me for J being upset with her, but it was really stupid of her expecting me to be sympathetic",2
"And I'm sure she ""solved it"" by refusing to talk to J about it.

So AITA for hanging onto her words when I know she exhibits Borderline Personality Disorder?

Or AITA for my reaction in the first place",1
"Did I read too much into her statement?

Perhaps he should just rent out that room and then send that money to you as child support,0
Win win.,1
"NTA, having a birthday go overlooked definitely hurts, but it's not a deal breaker to friends with whom your friendship is strong",1
Especially when you take mental and physical health into account,1
"When your friend said you were just making excuses, that sounds to me like it doesn't really understand what you're going through",2
"As far as your friends birthday, just send a few gentle reminders that you care and are thinking of pup randomly when you think about pup throughout the day/week",2
"One of my best friends knows that when I'm overwhelmed I can't reach out or respond, so they send me random ""**poke**"" messages to let me know they are thinking of me and that we are still friends",1
"Maybe start with a sincere apology, if you haven't already",1
And then later just drop a cute/happy image and tell pup that pup doesn't have to respond but you value pups friendship so you are going to keep reaching out and pup can respond back or not whenever pup chooses,1
"Even though pup probably won't respond right away, leaving a few messages in their inbox over a spread out amount of time will show pup that you do care",2
"But if pup asks you to leave pup alone, then it's super important to respect that boundary",1
Just remember that it's important not to overwhelm pup or to put any pressure on pup to respond,1
"And if you worry about remembering to drop pup a message, you can put a reminder in your phone or computer calendar",0
"I have ADHD so remembering dates and times and such is a struggle for me, too.",0

This implies that you would be sleeping solely in said spare room,0
"So first up, insist that any relations occur at your place, then when he is spending most nights there drop the bombshell that since he is staying over so often it is only fair that he be included on your lease and contribute to the rent",1
"But wait, there's more! Soon enough you will have your little bundle of joy",1
"If he doesn't want to provide housing for them, then he will need to pay child support.

  
That said, there is probably more to the various arguments along all of the financial lines here",1
"Yes his mortgage is only X, but does that include any community fees or is that seperate",0
What will the utilities be and the expected cost of double to triple the occupants,2
"There is one spare bedroom, with a child on the way is this housing going to be effective long term of should you both look at selling to buy a new place together?

"Love eachother, and realize you are both going to have to give a lot more to this than you are already thinking of.",1

I (21 F) and my sister (23 F) have never had any issues until last week",1
"She and her husband (23 M) had invited me over for a lunch, which is normal for us.

I have a severe shellfish allergy, even touching it makes me extremely itchy, my sister is completely aware of this and has been since we were children.

When I got to their house she said that food was already finished and in the fridge, she claimed that it was just a tuna pasta (yes, I can eat tuna, an many other fish, just nothing with a shell).

After she finished cleaning up we had a short conversation about what‚Äôs been happening in our lives since it had been a while since we‚Äôd seen each other",1
"I got this strange feeling from her but just brushed it off as I was extremely tired that day.

She grabbed the food out of the fridge and served it for me, giving me a small bowl ‚Äúin case I don‚Äôt like it‚Äù.

I couldn‚Äôt smell much of it, and from what I could smell I just assumed it was fish, but when I took a bite I almost immediately felt my throat burning",2
"I was coughing and grabbing at my throat, and her  husband kept asking me if I was choking.

My sister turned to me panicking and saying ‚ÄúI thought you were exaggerating!!‚Äù

An ambulance was called and i was rushed to the hospital, i was thankfully okay but they had made me stay to be monitored for nest two days.

My sister and BIL had tried to visit me but I told her to get out",1
She kept apologising and refusing to leave,0
"I told her that I‚Äôll be calling the police on her for what she‚Äôd done, as it‚Äôs literally attempted murder, and she lost it",0
"She kept screaming at me saying ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre faking this, you always act like you‚Äôre allergic to shellfish so I wanted to test you!‚Äù Id been pressing the call button for the nurse but they heard her regardless and had asked me if I wanted them removed",0
"I said yes.

I explained the whole situation to her and the hospital security and eventually decided that with the help of the nurse and security guards I‚Äôd file a report against her.

My mother is saying I‚Äôm overreacting and that I should have just cut contact, but I don‚Äôt know anymore",1

You mention the children are adults now, I am assuming your parents no longer have contact with your ex and her partner which would explain why you think OP‚Äôs parents should cut contact.

So I (25F) broke up with my ex few months back",2
It was a serious long term relationship for 6 years,2
But it was long distance most of the relationship,1
"We never really spent any alone time together.
The break up wasn't mutual, I did it",2
Mostly because I was fed up of long distance and couldn't take it anymore,2
I wanted to see him and I missed him a lot but with time my feelings changed and I got used to being alone,1
"And it wasn't like we couldn't see each other, he just didn't put it that effort",2
We were just so comfortable with each other that he never thought he was really important,1
We did love each other but it had become too much,1
"Also, we both were virgins and we both were ready to have sex with each other but it never happened because we never saw each other.

Break up was hard on my ex because he didn't want that but I was firm on my decision because he never did the effort to see me and it had been years since this has been going on and when I asked him to plan something, he never took it seriously or gave excuses.

We didn't talk for few months after we broke up but casually we started to call once in few weeks",2
"He always pleaded that we get back in relationship but I refused because I knew he will never really change.

Coincidentally we live in same cities now and we decided to meet",1
"I still don't want q relationship and he still wants a relationship.

We decided to take each other's virginity as FWB as it was our plan since many years",1
I suggested the idea and he enthusiastically agreed,1
I have confirmed this with him many times that this would be purely no strings attached and we will not get back together and he has agreed,1
He's going to see me in few days but now I'm having cold feet,2
I'm thinking he might get attached or might want to get back together,0
I also think that this will further complicate our lives,0
"And I also think having this kind of arrangement with ex is strange.

So should I refuse to have sex with him even though I suggested it in the first place or should I get it over with?

It also sounds homophobic and misogynistic, there‚Äôs an ideology that some people hold, where they think giving boys ‚Äúgirls‚Äù toys will make them gay",2
"First of all that‚Äôs stupid as fuck, nothing makes anyone gay",2
"Second of all that‚Äôs homophobic as fuck and if that kid grows up to be a gay person he‚Äôs going to have a rough time.
Being girly is not a bad thing either, who cares if a boy is interested in more stereotypically ‚Äúgirly‚Äù interests?
All that should matter is your kid is happy",1
OP I am completely on your side and I think it was a really sweet present,1
I‚Äôm glad he has you as his auntie,1
"My advice though, as much as I hate to say it, is you have to do what they ask, say it broke and that you had to throw it out and that you‚Äôll get him something else",2
"Idk what you‚Äôre gonna have to tell the kid honestly, that‚Äôs going to be the hardest part",1
"Maybe make his parents suffer and make them break the news to him or give you suggestions on how to break the news to him that the toy is gone.

I think it‚Äôs important to not rattle his parents too much,  buy him ‚Äúboys‚Äù toys üôÑ and to let him be himself at your house, as he grows up he‚Äôll hopefully understand that aunties house is a place to strip the bs gender norms his parents put on him and a place he can fully express himself",1
"Especially if by any chance he does end up being lgbt+ 

I‚Äôd hate for them to not allow him over anymore if you refuse to get him something different",2
Because I think it‚Äôs really important that he has you in his life if those are his parents beliefs,1
Best of luck to you,1

I am a female who is very introverted, but I still manage to make friends",1
One of those friends being my best male friend (I'll call him Male friend 1),1
"Me and Male friend 1 haven't been friends for the longest time, but I do consider him to be an important aspect to my life",1
"He makes me laugh, he cares about my feelings, we often hang out with each other, and all around a pretty good friend to have",1
"We have only been friends for 2 years, and yet we've been so close.

A worthy mention is that I have dated Male friend 1 before, but we had broken it off because I was not ready for a relationship",1
"During that time of our breakup, things were awkward for us, but we quickly managed to get friendly again, and we got close again as friends.

What happened recently is that Male friend 1 asked me on a date",1
"Considering we had gotten so close, and I was more comfortable with the idea of a relationship in my life, I accepted to go on a date with him",1
"Around 2 weeks or so later, another male friend of mine (I'll call him Male friend 2), suggested I meet a friend of his, as Male friend 2's friend wanted to meet me",0
"I was always down for new friends, so I accepted",2
"Me and this friend exchanged contact information, and we texted briefly",0
"It didn't take long for their texts to turn suggestive, and I was getting uncomfortable.

I texted Male friend 1 on how to politely decline their advances, since I wasn't really good at confrontation, and Male friend 1 told me to tell them I had someone already",2
"It would've been an easy lie, if Male friend 2 hadn't told his friend that I was already single, and I told Male friend 1 this fact",1
"Male friend 1 then texts me, quote ""I thought we were dating.""

I was confused",2
"I accepted to go on a date, not be official",0
"But right then I was thinking, did I misread the lines? Did I just not get that I was supposed to be in a relationship with him? Was it the norm to be official after agreeing to a date? Me and Male friend 1 texted, my texts full of confusion and apologies, in which his were filled with hurt",1
"My intent wasn't to hurt him, but now he won't talk to me or even be around me in public.

AITA for not understanding the normal circumstances and hurting his feelings?

NTA absolutely not the asshole,2
Jack will most likely grow into that mindset and convince himself that he needs to fit into certain boxes and not be himself because of those toxic gender norms,1
The fact that they're threatening and willing to cut contact between you and Jack because of a single differing opinion on gender norms is just horrible,2
"I don't know how harsh your brother is about this whole thing, but if you have really tried and still can't get your point across that you believe his happiness is more important than his manliness (At literally seven), I would back off a little  for the sake of keeping things together and just accept Jack for who he is more on the down-low, maybe by doing small things that wont last or just being there for him as he grows up in that way if that makes any sense",1
"Because at the end of the day he is their child, but you can still be there for him and try your best to show him that acceptance he might not be getting from them any time soon.",1

"You say it's unfair that you have to do manual labour after your job but why is it fair that your husband has to do his job, everything with the children and everything else",2
"So you plan the fun activities on your day off? Woop de doo that's called actually being a mother, which half the time sounds like you get to avoid most of the time, except for a brief moment in the morning.

Maybe you should use some of your extra money to hide a gardener or a babysitter at the very least if you don't want to do anything",1

"I do believe that what a big achievement looks like is different for every one, but this ain‚Äôt it Jan",0

Food is a resource that is not always plentiful,0

Well for a start you asked someone with autism about celebrating an Achievement whilst putting them on the spot,0
As someone with autism the first thing that would have done was taken you literally and the fishing thing would have popped up on their screen with the word Achievement written above it,1

If you had sat with him and talked about his time at school and asked him about what he‚Äôd been struggling with and has he managed to do better at anything you would have probably got a completely different answer rather than the word association.,1

"I agree it‚Äôs not safe and should be avoided‚Äîother studies have found that THC produces psychomotoric impairment, particularly slower reflexes, which definitely translates to driving errors, and if mixed with alcohol drivers can be under blood alcohol limits and yet *more* impaired than with either alcohol or THC alone",1

Josh calling your friend a ‚Äúyoung punk‚Äù made me laugh,1
Good job.,1
You're NTA cause you had the best intentions and I appreciate that,1
"Having said that, the way you went about it wasn't great",2
"Routines in care homes exist for good reason, both for clients and staff",1
"For example, set mealtimes mean that it's possible to keep an eye on food and liquid intake of clients, which is important, even more so if they're on a bunch of medications which is usually the case",1
"By doing things at set times, it's ensured stuff like that doesn't get lost in the sauce during shift changes",0
"That doesn't mean people can't have nice things they are interested in, but those need to be fitted into the existing routines",1
"So, Bob turning up to play for an hour or two during regular visiting times is awesome, Bob being there for six hours may be disruptive",1
"And hey, if they only play for an hour or two, maybe Bob can come back the following week for another game.",2

"It could be because op paid $700 to gift them a new working fridge, and moms acting like op wronged her or something",1
"That‚Äôs probably not what she‚Äôs feeling, I wonder if that was a gifted fridge from a loved one that‚Äôs sentimental to her so it pains her to see it go, but if OP just paid $700 for a gift, and just assumed moms upset about a refrigerator their feelings got hurt too",1
Op is wrong to call her out but their feelings are understandable too.,2
NTA tell him to grow up and that it‚Äôs your choice,0
it doesn‚Äôt matter if he‚Äôs unhappy with YOUR wedding choices.,2

You would have to be crazy to send your child back to a house where they are this neglectful,2

There is no guarantee that you would be informed or she would be brought to the hospital to be checked out,0

What does wife expect with 4 young kids eating in the car?,1
YTA- Achievements should be celebrated based on their ability,1
For example my sister would congratulate her daughter for getting a B+ but her son had to get an A for the same congratulations,0
According to my nephew that is favoritism,0
"My sister corrected him and said, ‚Äúyour sister studied her ass off to get the B+ and you sat on your ass and did nothing for the A-",0
"Until you study and get the A, you won‚Äôt get any kudos.‚Äù ¬† My nephew is incredibly smart and sister is average intelligence",1
Guess who is in medical school? ¬† My niece because of all her hard work,2
Her brother coasted,0
YTA but not in the specific way your kid says,0
"I‚Äôm on the spectrum, even I think it‚Äôs a bit more of a self celebration type of thing or at the very least should be a low funded celebration when it comes to things that are more rooted in quick and fleeting pleasure with no room for advancement unless he is planning to game professionally as a career choice",1
"You can determine what is worth it, to see what milestones in life each individual child has achieved according to their own pace",1
I celebrated when a game was fully completed as a kid but to the proportional degree it deserved,2
My sister and I went out and got ice cream with my parents cash,0
"I think for this one, going out to a gaming or comic event with a friend might be a good proportional celebration",1
Your child just wants to feel just as appreciated and loved as their siblings,1
"Setting boundaries is normal, just don‚Äôt skip a kid over like you have been doing.",1
NTA,0
"If you're working that day, you can't babysit, plain and simple",2
"I suggest that you make that a boundary, regardless of whether you agree to babysit on days that you don't work",0
"It's too easy for WFH or independant/small business owner to be taken advantage of because ""you can watch her while you work, it's easy"".",1
"NTA.
But your parents want you to die",0
You have got to move out IMMEDIATELY,0
"Worst case scenario you get the dog, sis is pissed you are calling it only YOUR dog, and parents decide to get rid of it",2
It's their house so you can't stop them,0
"Or, even worse you come home one day and the dog ""ran away"" because sis is annoyed so either she or the parents dumped it somewhere (my SO's family did this, it is not that uncommon).

Wait until you move out, or MAYBE sis does",2
You should not get a dog under these circumstances,0
Do it when you control the household,0
"Right now you are clearly the last one in order of importance in that household and just because you pay for everything to do with a pet does not mean you will have any control over what happens to it.

To answer your question, yes, just showing up with a dog would make YTA",1
Because if things go wrong the dog will pay the price.,2

But pooping multiple times a day? Unless he's hijacking the bathroom for hours on end, I don't really see the issue",1
"OP, YTA.",0
Would you seriously put on an invitation that your kid maxed out fishing on a video game? And expect people to come celebrate in the same way they celebrate a scholarship to a top tier university?,2
He sounds like the AH to me,0
There's obviously a reason that his child doesn't see her that way or maybe he just doesn't want to see it that way,0
Poor kid must start getting scared when anything regarding family or mums gets brought up in school or anywhere else,2
Man needs to let his child speak to him calmly,1
Always gotta be the ex *facepalm,0
Nta,0
Kindness and engagement and straight up fun is so valuable,1
Scrambled eggs on toast is a totally normal dinner and probably better than what was served anyway if we are honest,1
I think it might get a bit morally murky to invite people in to meet your patients,2
Definitely something you'd need to ask them if they are interested in before,1
I still don't think you did anything wrong tho.,2
YTA why can‚Äôt you celebrate him? Celebrate he‚Äôs gotten through school to whatever grade and everything else he has done including being a gamer,0
You family and friends know him know he‚Äôs on the spectrum and can‚Äôt be like his siblings and cousins but he still deserves some love and attention within his family for what are successes for him,1
Stop comparing him to your other family members.,2

Hi there - before I pick a fight with my (32F) partner (38M), I wanted to test whether my position is reasonable",1
We have been together for two years and have a great relationship,1
"My partner values his own space - he was single for ten years before we met - however is kind, loving and considerate",1
"We both own our own apartments, and spend 4-5 nights together each week",1
"We have discussed marriage and children, and planned to try for a baby in the next 12 months",0
"We had a happy surprise last week - I am pregnant, which we are both very excited about",1
"We have discussed me moving in to his apartment, which he bought a long time ago, and owes comparatively little on",2
"I bought my apartment three years ago, so have a larger balance and monthly mortgage payment ($3k per month, plus $400 for body corp, rates, water)",0
"My partner pays $1300 each month for his mortgage, and suggested that as he could rent his spare room out for $1000 a month on the open market, I should pay him that in rent",0
"Meaning, he effectively no longer has much of a mortgage payment",1
"I would only be able to rent out my place out for $2600, meaning that I would still need to pay $800 each month (extra $400 towards mortgage, plus normal $400 body corp/rate payment)",1
"So, my housing related costs would be $1800, while his would be $300 (plus whatever his body corp fees are)",0
"While this would be more than fair for a normal tenant, I feel like it's strange to turn a profit off your partner, particularly when we are having a child together",1
I don't want him to feel like my landlord,0
"I earn a little bit more than he does, however the take home difference is minimal after tax",1
"I also have quite a lot of leave saved up, so still expect to be drawing the same income while on maternity leave",1
"AITA? I assumed that we would split his $1300 mortgage payment between us, however in his eyes, he sees his proposal as a win-win for both of us, as I am still paying less than I would be if I continued to live alone",1
"Let me know your thoughts...

"I sadly have to say YTA because of how you handled this but seriously, the mum and bf are ok with dad making lewd comments and staring at you, but then get all shocked pikachu when you finally crack? Sure you could have handled that in a more mature way but you really shouldn't have had to handle it at all.

I sincerely hope you break up with your bf and tell him to tell his creepy dad to f@@@ off.",2

YTA because you are holding him to an unachievable level for him and then punishing him for it,0
You've basically acknowledged as such and seem very blas√© about remedying that,1
As others have pointed out you could find achievements to celebrate - a marked improvement in a subject he has previously struggled with (academic achievement isn't just H1s and scholarships) or he may compete in online gaming tournaments so you could find something there for him,2
You are punishing your son because your sense of pride is inflexible.,0

"But in the future, if he breaks free from that..",0
"the support of a good friend can be incredibly helpful when trying to escape a relationship like that, not that it's your responsibility to help him",1
"That's a long time to be friends, so I wouldn't write him off entirely",2

"If you don‚Äôt want to send that impression, then you can‚Äôt ‚Äúcelebrate‚Äù his cousins more than him, regardless of achievements.",1
"The only thing you should have learned from this post is that you shouldn't take the money at all, but you are too stupid and selfish for that...",2
"Yes the world will be harder, he needs to adjust to it",2
"He is desperate for the attention and praise his siblings are getting, but they worked and achieved something amazing for that praise, if he is given the same reward it teaches him terrible habits, for someone who is around 15, approval is like crack, if he just gets in instead of working for it like his siblings had to, what precedent do you think that sets?",2
Why r u comparing a kid to a university student first of all? Also it is your responsibility to teach him HEALTHY ways to deal with failure,1
Do you know why he gives up anything hes not perfect at for the first time? Because he knows YOU dont see worth in him,1
He feels like he has to be perfect at first try to gain your approval because you dont accept his own speed of doing stuff,1
Its YOUR FAULT he gives up on everything he feels crap at,2
Because you make him feel like crap any time he doesn‚Äôt succeed so fast as his cousins,2
BE PROUD OF HIM FOR ONCE EVEN FOR THE EFFORT!!! Encourage him to not give up dont belittle him and throw others parties! What the actual fuck is wrong with you lol,1
Some kids do need positive reinforcement to thrive and his cousins obviously are thriving because of it,1
"Do the same to your own fucking kid even if it‚Äôs something as small as ‚Äúthank you for not quitting and for DOING YOUR BEST‚Äù
YTA ofc",1
You are somewhat correct but also wrong,2
In disclosing to her friend the residents identity (he even researched him) and his residency (to be a resident means you have a medical need) plus that he suffers from dementia she violated HIPPA and by bringing in a stranger without permission she violated his right to privacy.,0

That must have been a real second hand embarrassment for you.,1
The celebration is going to be on a different level though,0
Maxing out a fishing stat on a game is simply not on the same level as being scouted for a college scholarship,2
Life is unfair,2
It‚Äôs unfair that a kid in my state who is a national polocrosse champion doesn‚Äôt get the same attendance exemptions as a kid playing netball or rugby league,2
It‚Äôs also not fair that a kid who can afford to play polocrosse probably has a lot of long term advantages over the rugby league kid.,2

You‚Äôre definitely the AH.,0
"Even if she doesn't remember you, that does not abscond you from the responsibility towards her as a human being",0

Exactly,1
He has a lot of time to learn these things.,1
Jesus I'm a professor and I can think of so many times I've been proud of some poor performing students when they keep trying,1
And those are whole adult human beings I see for 15 weeks then never again,1
Still proud of them,1
"Proud of many of the all A students too.

Not the loud cocky asshole students who don't know jack about shit and don't care to change it",1
"I'll grade them fairly and all, but man am I glad to see them go...

Anyway, love on your kid a little more, OP!",1
My fianc√©e has the exact same thing (she's also on the spectrum),1
I don't touch her when she is like that at all (also if she is and I'm unaware I stop immediately at her request) and I will go ape on anyone who refuses to respect her wishes in that regard,0
So tell friend and family that this guy thinks they're full of scheiss,1
NTA  Your cousin and your mother are not showing any respect for the work you do,0
"Yes, cousin wants the end product and mother wants you to just make her look good by providing it but the fact that it is a professional activity with standards and requirements - not acknowledged at all",1
And the lack of discussion about whether it's feasible etc,0
just reinforces that,0
If cousin wanted a wedding day tattoo he could have arranged to come down and have you do it and then reveal it after the marriage,2
"Or he (and wife?  what does she think about this?) can visit another time, after he has discussed what he wants and you have agreed on a design and you have an idea of how much work he is asking you to provide, presumably for free",1
But at the wedding - no,0
Don't let them pressure you because you don't want to hurt your  growing career with something going seriously wrong.,2
"i mean, ur so real for that and that's probably what i would've done if i went lol",1
Thank you! I scrolled too far for this,1
She absolutely did by disclosing his health information (that he has dementia) and also violated his rights,1
I‚Äôm being downvoted for this on other comments but it is driving me nuts how no one sees this was a violation.,2

I used to be the overachiever in my family,0
"Honor student, trophies in athletics, lots of extra classes  etc",0
My siblings did the same things and some even put more effort into it than I did,1
Still I was the one being celebrated and treated to nice things all the time just because I happened to have more talent,1
"Which isn't bad, but it made my siblings feel ""less"" and started causing resentment",2
Eventually they stopped trying,0
We went to family therapy when I was in my teens and the therapist suggested to not only celebrate results,0
Celebrate the effort,0
We did that with my sibling's B in Maths,0
"Not because it was an outstanding grade, but because we wanted to aknowledge the fact that they put a lot of effort into studying and improved their grade.

Sometimes you can't be the best at something no matter how hard you try",1
"Endurance is a thing worth to be praised on its own, regardless of the end result",1
But it's also hard to keep trying and do your best if no one aknowledges your effort or has some nice words for you when you fail even though you gave it your best.,1

Sorry you wasted your day but even then you saw the positive side of things,2
You sound lovely OP,1
Wishing you the best in everything and please never fall for your step sisters manipulation or entitlement again,1
What is wild to me is that no one is discussing the adverse effect of HIPAA/other confidentiality violations,1
"Even if it was with good intentions, OP revealed identifying and medical information to someone who is a complete stranger to the patient without prior permission from either the patient, their loved ones, or a healthcare provider with sufficient training and information about the patient's wishes to decide whether the revealing of this information is justified.",1

My grandpa had Parkinson's for decades before he died,0
He used to love driving and boating,1
"His license was taken away when his symptoms became too intense, but he convinced my grandma to let him keep his golf cart to drive around their neighborhood",1
A few years later he crashed into my grandma's car trying to get it out of the garage and she made him get rid of it,2
"He started deteriorating quickly after that and she had to put him in a nursing home, which was good for him because he was able to get a motorized chair and he liked just doing laps around the complex in that.",1
"Other than throwing money at him and other people, what have you actually done to support your kid? Seriously? It‚Äôs like you never truly outgrew that trust fund db phase",2
How is kid supposed to learn perseverance and learning his limits as a disabled kid if you don‚Äôt facilitate a safe place for him to explore his limits? Sounds like you resent your own kid for being disabled.,1
">While at the other time, also being sensitive to my traumatized friend",2
You're mad that she can't go on a trip due to trauma,2
"How is that being sensitive?

"Ohhh, that makes sense",0
Then leave her alone if you can't be nice,1

NTA and I can't believe all these people who say you are,0
Your son is a person and YOU treat him like a person and have expectations for him as a person,0
Him having autism means his brain works a little different but it is still fully functional,1
"Him having autism doesn't mean he needs to be treated like a child who can't do better than a game, which is what all these reddit psychologists seem to think is all that he is capable of",1
"To me, this is not about celebrating achievements, this is about setting expectations, and given out participation trophies has never helped anyone in the long run.

However, I do think it would be good if you had a proper, open chat with your son about his wants and expectations for the future",1
"Maybe he does want to achieve 'real' accomplishments, but he doesn't know how to get there (and that may be why he says this game skill is an accomplishment) and he needs a little extra guidance.",2
"ilyt pls dont settle, ik its easy to hang onto the sliver of hope, but girl DONT..",1
thats how they keep u without having to put any real effort..,1
Just a note to say that very fit and mentally acute people get dementia too,1
It‚Äôs not a lifestyle choice,0

Asthma can be deadly and not being able to breathe is terrifying,2

I also think it's better to call for help and find out you didn't need it than to not call for help and find out you DID need it.,1

I feel like my wife is being a bit naive with her siblings, and I'm wondering if it would be overstepping to express my feelings about this.



For some context, I'm the sole earner in our household",2
My wife works occasionally and has some savings,0
I provide her with a monthly budget for personal expenses without any questions,0
"However, I've noticed over the past few years that she's been spending most of this money on her siblings instead of herself",2
"Her sister's family, who live in another country, seems to be struggling financially, especially with the recent birth of their sixth child",1
"I understand why my wife wants to help them, and her parents also contribute to supporting her sister's family.

Recently, my wife's sister asked for her help in taking care of the other five kids while she focuses on the newborn",1
"My brother-in-law works long hours, so my wife asked me to pay for her flight",2
"Although I was a bit annoyed since I don't feel responsible for covering these expenses, I gave her a budget of $1,000 for the trip",2
"She wanted a direct flight that cost about $1,600",1
"While I could afford the extra cost, I told her to use her savings for the difference",0
"She got annoyed and said it was my responsibility to pay, but she eventually used her savings",2
"Now, she frequently makes underhanded remarks about it, and it's starting to weigh on my conscience because she seems to think I'm in the wrong.

Adding to my frustration, her parents offered to cover the flight, but she refused and insisted that I pay for it",2
She didn't even consult me before making this decision,0
"When she returns, I plan to confront her about this and address the fact that we always give expensive gifts to her family",2
"When we meet in person, I end up paying for restaurants while my brother-in-law only covers his own family's costs",1
"I feel like I'm being taken advantage of, and I‚Äôm not sure how to handle it.



Would I be the asshole (WIBTA) if I brought this up with her?

"NTA

Have you told your parents and brother the date and venue yet? If not, keep this information to yourself just in case you decide to not have any of them at the wedding",0
"You don't want them trying to crash the venue.¬†
I agree with what another user said, that your parents are trying to make themselves feel better for the way they failed you (and your brother)",1
"They think that if you don't choose him as your best man, it will show everyone that they failed to raise you properly",1
It really is all about them.,1
YTA,0
I don't think you realise how difficult maxing your fishing stat is.,2
">But we're only going to try with a little and then we can do more if it's good."" And actually been an adult


Did you not bother to read the post at all before commenting? That's exactly what OP was like ffs",1
Agreed partially but OP should NOT bring Bob back if they want to keep their job,0
They need to check with the right people to arrange this otherwise OP is going to keep violating HIPPA and the residents rights.,1
Lol you sure showed him.,1
YTA because your kid is telling you he doesn‚Äôt feel as loved or valued,1
"You‚Äôre placing emphasis on achievements that are down to a mix of skill, luck and hard work",2
"When your son applies himself to the best of his abilities and comes up lacking in your eyes, you‚Äôre telling him he‚Äôs worth less because he‚Äôs ‚Äònot normal‚Äô",1
Thats how he sees it,0
Autism is a complex condition that means the vast majority of modern day events and things cause pain,2
"Sound, light, touch, texture, taste‚Ä¶ even trying to maintain eye contact has been proven to cause physical pain.¬†

So son is going through life basically crippled with his heart breaking seeing his happy healthy cousins and siblings get doted on for the miracle of being born different to him.¬†

Hell there‚Äôs every chance it‚Äôs not even the celebrations that he truly wants, it‚Äôs recognition and attention from his dad who seems to think just throwing money around counts as showing love",1
"When you equate money to affection, then spend more on people that aren‚Äôt your kids, of course they‚Äôre going to be upset",1
"You taught them that connection, you told them they aren‚Äôt worth your money/love.¬†

Instead of finding ‚Äòexcuses‚Äô to celebrate your kid (like you claim), why not find something you can both bond over? An activity where you actually pay attention to your kid and listen to him rather than quietly resenting he‚Äôs not as successful as his non-disabled cousins.",1
yeah but if he was genuine he would make effort to change the behaviors/ accept her boundaries!,1
NTA,0
She is,0
"not surprising to find that in the person your brother, also TA ,married.",1
It‚Äôs not always easy to know what to do in a situation like this but pulling your tits at your boyfriends creepy dads request is pretty high up on the what not to do list,2
Especially if you want to keep said boyfriend.,0
This is ridiculous,2
"If your sister wanted to stay at your home, she should've just asked",0
And if she didn't want to stay with Frank she should've said that,0
Your sister is in a situation of her making.,0
"Yes, me too, i hope you guys do it again - but not missing a dinner",0
I am happy for the old guy and i am proud of you OP,1
Eden needs to shut up,0
"Sorry, but she mad you did not offer her a spot when she already aggreed to stay with someone else? She is the one who blasted it online to everyone that she needed a spot, instead of calling you directly",2
Doesn't seem Eden is to good at taking accountability,1
"Could be why she is bad with money.....

OP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:

 > I thought (correctly) that I covered both of these points in 
my original post, but (1) I cherry pick posts wherein I can
scold someone, and (2) I seek out people to correct, but only
those that are in the wrong.

You discussed your patient with someone who is not providing healthcare to him,0
"You either described him with enough detail that he could be identified through that, or you revealed his identity by taking him to this person before the visitor knew his name",0
"Where I live and work in a nursing home it would already be a violation of confidentiality to acknowledge in any way that I know my patient when we are not in the nursing home unless the patient acknowledges me first, and even then I cannot add any information to the conversation other than what they are saying",1
"I don't know where you live or which laws apply to you, but combining location, identifying information (for chess champion + name/taking visitor to see patient thus revealing name), and medical information (diagnosis/cognitive decline, healthcare he receives) and revealing this to someone who is a stranger to your patient and does not provide healthcare to them is absolutely not okay under HIPAA or pretty much any other law",1
"So no, you are NTA for throwing off the schedule, but YTA for violating the privacy that your patient is entitled to no matter how cognitively declined he is",0

Next time you want to discuss your work with someone either make sure that confidentiality laws apply to them or do a better job keeping the patients you discuss anonymous.,1

"What does it matter how serious the injury was?

Ok,1
