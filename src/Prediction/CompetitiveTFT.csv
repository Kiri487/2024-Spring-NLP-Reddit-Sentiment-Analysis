Dishsoap has incredible game knowledge and you are perfect at pulling information out of him without turning any topic or question into a ramble,1
I learn so much every time I listen.,1
"I find climbing easier when the patch have been settled down, so you generally know some default line to go for, or when the patch is brand new and hopefully you can abuse some new comps by watching challengers players before the comp get too popular on many website/videos, etc",1

Play strongest board, slam items, have a plan in mind for lvl 8, but try not to be too inflexible in case you don't hit (but also be influenced by what's uncontested)",0
If a comp is giga uncontested I wouldn't roll down on stage 4 until slightly later (at least 4-3 onwards) so that the pool of 4 costs has been taken out by others,2
"I hate rolling to 0, so I will try to roll as much as needed to feel stable, then econ back up to 9.",2

MY WANDERING TRAINER ISNT WORKING SMFH FIRST AUGMENT,1
With each patch just confirms that the dev team doesn't play the game at all.,2
So stupid to put into a RANKED game mod,2
I don't know how exactly it works but I'm guessing it calculates the board strength of both players and uses data from previous matchups to make a prediction,1
I don't think it includes board positioning at all or account for stuff like playing a ghost,0
Aug calculations are off,0
Iirc they said exalted calculations are also super scuffed,1
Only times I can see it being useful is like early stage 2 when you have to slam something unoptimal in order to win the round,1
But it's not nearly accurate enough to actually be used like that reliably,2
So like one other step of isolating the variable and then division? That's just like one more simple calculator calculation lol it's faster to do it without chatgpt lol,1
Yeah lee sin is so fucking OP atm because all the other strong comps have almsot no single target damage,1
"So long as each new patch doesn't have some blatantly broken/OP unit or comp that everyone is already forcing/contesting for free top 4s, then climbing is usually easier a few days AFTER a patch",1
This is because most people don't know what's going on and what comps to blindly force,1
But this also means you need to know what comps might be strong and play those yourself.,1
It's not just division,0
It's like 3-step algebra where you have to get x alone to find the total player base.,2
"I think it does a really poor job accounting for (somewhat understandably) artifacts and augments.

I also dont know if it uses positioning at all",2
"An ashe comp this set is basically a coin flip into a similar strength board based in positioning, just as an example.",0
skipping level 8 is pretty much a no go right no,1
"all the 4 costs are gone, and youre unlikely to hit enough 5 cost upgrades to be able to contend with upgraded level 8 boards even if youre rolling like 50g on 9.",2
I really hope they notice a severe drop in player base,2
This set has just not worked out,0
Not the set mechanic,0
Not the units,0
Not the traits,0
Not the meta,0
"Ah well, at least it was good to take a break from the game for a while.",1
Why do people need chatgpt to divide two numbers?,0
Yo true I really forgot about Hwei,1
💀,0
Yeah that'd be a good way to do it,1
"Frankly I agree with you, but I can definitely understand the devs opting for simplicity over balance.",1
"idk maybe it could've been something like ""Your strongest Garen's Ability now grants stacking max Health instead of Shield at 85% value"" so it's not a complete 1:1 conversion rate",2
but yeah maybe overcomplicated,0
"darn, thanks for letting me know",1
I pray for the day this podcast is 3 hours long gachigasm,2
Shitter Neeko opener into empty krugs should be illegal lmao,1
"I work in a tiny software company where 9ish people play tft, we can't play on PC since we are using Linux, it's fun cause we can play on our breaks",1
will there be a pbe for this game mode?,2
"Hopefully next set they can see that having a generic 4 cost tank that stuns your entire board multiple times per fight isn't something that is required, there's other ways to promote positioning, or controlling melee units.",2
Riot doesn't really give out RP/eggs for stuff like that anymore,2
I've only seen it happen with content creators.,0
"is there a worse feeling than not hitting on an uncontested roll down, meanwhile the 2 other double contested comps hit everything?",2
Agreed,0
I mean compared with older sets i think it was good,1
Just not as amazing as Set 10.,1
"Is climbing easier a few days before the patch and if so, why?",2
some coworkers are interested in setting up a small tourney,2
does anyone know how to connect with Riot to request RP/egg prizes? is there a standard method for reaching out to them about this?,0
I just use my rank # and my top % and then let chat GPT do the algebra ^XD,1
"how did you get those, did you just scrape from a leaderboard ?",0
RIP.,0
Yikes,0
When is the win chance useful to know?,1
"I'd guess they wanted to nerf his tankiness rather than damage, and adding ""his ability now costs 10 more mana"" to the augment would overcomplicate the augment description.",1

The amount of B patches we get that aren't exclusively for bug fixes or touching up entire character/trait reworks (Karthus set 10 and multicaster come to mind as decent examples) highlight that there needs to be more time between the release of a patch and the lock-in for the next one.

If anything the B patches make the issue worse because it shrinks that time frame even more",1

They have to find fastly a solution to the 10 days before patch lock,1
It gives us bad patches that feels useless if nothing become op tier like 2 days after the patch,2
"How can you work like that? It's just impossible to predict what the meta will be in 2 weeks, like they release the patch and only have 3/4 days to fastly look on what is trendy and more fastly try to repair what seems brokken",1
It won't last long if we have outdated patch,2
It's been atleast a month since we have out of meta patch,0
Please riot find a solution.,0
"tft team is full of former hearthstone devs now, what do you expect?",1
I think the play style and balance are fine it’s just mind numbingly exhausting seeing game after game with giga capped boards and taking a bot 4s after well played games.,2
Look at legends of Runeterra - that’s what happens when player base goes down,2
"Less resources get put into the game meaning less updates, smaller budget etc which noone wants",2

"Again, your complaint makes no sense with the development timeline nor is it healthy for the game",2

It sounds to me you want a patch the MOMENT you are unhappy with the meta.

Apart from the league client 2 week patch cycle, you do understand the TFT team releases their own independent patches? B patches hello????????? Which again, you run into the 6-7 days lead time for mobile app updates to be approved by app stores",1

It would allow them to change the patch cycle,0
"Sure, I could have worded it better, the issue is not exclusively the lead time for locking in a patch",1

"Most patches this set have had meta changes within the second week, which because of the lock in, causes both legitimate balance difficulties and the oh so important perception of balance is already soured before the next patch can even drop",1

"Uhh 3 cost carries are still fucking useless, 2 cost is somewhat usable and matches tempo which is good that they dont trash it too",1
Everyone knows to play this set already,0
"Theres not much to br discussed, unless an bad patch comes out.",2
"Agreed, and although Set 10 had a similar stint (maybe not as long) with the ezreal 4-2 lvl7 rolldown, there was definitely more discussion potential with min-maxxing flex boards with an assorted rolldown.

Set 11 often feels like if you don’t hit your level 8 comp’s specific trait breakpoints + 4-cost carries early in stage 4, you’re bleeding a lot on stage 4 and having a much harder time capping at 9 compared to the ones that have.

But, I’m just yapping and repeating what everyone else has said for the past month",1

Mortdog addressed this in his stream,0
"It's not because of the ""league client.""

When they release a patch, it goes to mobile too",0
Mobile updating process requires a lead time of 6-7 days,0
"So even if they were OWN THEIR OWN CLIENT, it won't solve the issue you think there is.

Mortdog also does not release the numbers of desktop and mobile players",1
Which gives me a feeling that there is a A LOT of mobile players.,1
> Its not about having the localization done and inputting it - its getting the localization done in the first place,1
"Once its ready for deployment sure they can deploy it instantly 

History has indicated this is also untrue, they are bound to League's patching structure",1
"They don't seem to be able to deploy at will.

I'm quite aware of the complexities of updating localization strings in a video game",1
"Generally speaking, I agree with the philosophy of holding back significant changes until they can be properly tested in the next content update.

I think being stuck with two patches -- one with a significant content lock (A patch), and the other allowing for a rapid turnaround (B patch), is starting to fall behind the velocity at which the game is being solved by the players",1
"The availability of stats tools and the speed at which the playerbase adopts new strategies can create periods of time where the game is less fun/balanced than its potential.

I'd like to see the team invest in a better engineering infrastructure to make minor changes at a greater frequency (or at will), at least at the cadence of [Marvel Snap's OTA updates](https://marvelsnapzone.com/news/ota-balance-updates/)",1
Give the designers better tools and levers to make micro adjustments and keep outlier compositions more in line.,1
"Honestly yeah, I remember when there were always new threads here",1
"Now it’s like maybe 1 thread every day or two, I get that this set is unpopular and pros have said it’s impossible to balance this set but still it doesn’t look good.",1
"This might be the set i have played the least off out of every set since set 1, i'm not sure on the statistic side of things but i feel like there hasnt been ANY relevant major changes in the meta in 2 months besides small varations",1
After the 3 cost change it has been copy paste comps every single game.,2
"Really bad patch, should nerf all gold augments related to champs, all are overtuned in current meta.",2
"agreed - also, none of them are winning augments either unless you high roll supporting items/augments - say, bruiser spat for lucky paws etc.",1

">The virtual concert was Set

You are right I mixed up set themes",1
Although set 9 was developed by the same team as 3 and 6 (I believe the tft team is split into three groups),0
Half sets are always less because people burn out of the champions/traits even if they are updated,2
You can die on the arcane hill but you could make the same argument as soul fighter where it impacted league more than TFT,1
The point I was making still stands,0
I would like to see raw games played numbers,2
The player base stat is such an obvious way to obfuscate the actual numbers because 90% of gold players just play to get the rewards and then quit.,2
I dont really hold either opinion- but I think its misrepresentative to try to compare numbers between sets because the player base has probably grown overtime,2
A better comparison would be % dropoff (but even then theres a lot of factors),1
"why is meta tft win chance so garbage since the last 2-3 patches?

what happened? used to be ok",1
"But when I filter without the Fine Vintage argument, Zephyr doesn't seem to perform well",1
Why is there this difference?,0
The virtual concert was Set 10,0
Set 9 only had the soul fighter event which was 90% main League related,1
I also already pointed out that set 9 had a million more than 6.5 did so wouldn't that argument work both ways? The half set difference was only 300k so there is a **very** good chance that the start of set 6 was heavily inflated by Arcane curious people who played a few games then dropped,1
"They literally held virtual concerts for set 9 isnt that a ""boost""? A million more players, especially if they are active, is roughly 15% of the player base",2
"I don't think that is a negligible number?

I wish I could see the total games played in each set",0
That would honestly be the best metric because it would show how much people actually played and enjoyed a set,1
Compare that with the number of days that a set existed you can average and get a better picture.,1
What do you mean no one wants that? I personally could deal with way less brain dead meta forcers blind contesting me in literally every lobby,2
I miss when tft was about cooking creative comps & solving the set over time.,1
"I honestly think lillia is fine, most of the problem is kaisa/kayn being basically dead units.",1
"Isn't it a 50/50 weather voli or Lee occupy the slot first and the other will have to walk arround? Not sure ""the unit with a clear path"" will move first.",1
Idk how to fast 9 anymore,1
"Even if I play for winstreak and be 90+ hp at 4-1, if I don't roll down all my gold 4-1, by the time I get to 9, I find no copies of what I want to play",2
"I see pretty much no irelia, azir, wukong by stage 5-1",1
I do see some players fast 9 to play xayah trickshot so maybe I can try that.,1
"So are we just going to ignore everything else i said?

Its not about having the localization done and inputting it - its getting the localization done in the first place",1
Once its ready for deployment sure they can deploy it instantly - but they lock changes in advance to prevent scope creep and having a set amount of things that need to be done before the patch,1
"Changes after that point cannot be translated so they avoid doing anything that would touch text.

See lissandra a few patches ago - mort had already said he was quite confident they were going to remove the throw part of her spell but due to content lock they weren't able to do it that patch",1
Unless the small change they did to her suddenly made her balanced/underpowered as hell they were still going to go through with the mini rework the following patch.,2
Often times yes,0
Especially with multiple things changing,0
Units don't exist in a vacuum.,0
> I feel it is very unfair that they design the game for people who play 3 lobbies a week,2
They design the game for people who spend money.,2
You don't want to be speedy and big?! :O,0
"Surely, while professional tft players in GSC don't scout before commiting to a comp and mindlessly slam items/pick augments

Most of challenger lobbies are a Disneyland and you're talking about geniuses in master lobbies",1
TFT is dead to me whatever the current status of the game is,2
Updates continue to feel lack luster.,0
If lillia can't snipe your backline early she's meh at best...,1
"Probably because the set's been pretty one-dimensional for the past few weeks.

Since the 4-cost buffs and odds changes, every patch has more or less been ""push 8 and roll for the meta 4 cost of the month."" The playstyle's been figured out for a while now so there just isn't much to discuss, the only difference now is that you play for Lilia instead of Kaisa.

Reroll being more or less dead doesn't help either",1
"Lots of players enjoy the reroll playstyle and those who enjoyed comps like Country, Seraphine, Annie, or Senna from last patch are most likely not having the most fun in a meta where the best play in 90% of games is to play strongest board until 8 then press D at 4-2.",1
"No it's not? The worst performing item for Irelia was static shiv followed by bloodthirster, QSS, etc",2
The fact that it was played as her second most common item at 35% playrate while she was bugged and it was still a viable choice is actually insane,2
It was the worst performing item on her,2
damn have to wait until Thursday for the patch since it was Memorial Day this week,0
A season ruined by the worst patch,2
This season's patch is such a mess,2
The tft team's understanding of the game is at its lowest and they don't play the game,2
They just look at statistics and play with numbers.,0
Is this the deadest a set's ever been? Not in gameplay numbers but in discussion,0
Isn’t that exactly what all complainers ask for?,1
"Lol, no",1
The playerbase would fall off a cliff.,0
I've been playing other games man for over a month now,2
"Its not even the shitty balance for me that much, the game in it's current state is just really fucking boring",2
You have a couple of flavor of the month comps dominating everything and the rest is just unclickable,0
When you already know what you will play before you even load in and its either you hit or you dont its just bad game design,2
"At one hand you have something that's healthy like exalted, on the other hand you are being pidgeonholed by balance thrashing and poor design",2
You can't even really blame the balance team because the kits of the units are so stupidly overloaded they are either too strong or too weak and you can't really find a middle ground on it,2
We are seeing the effects of powercreep in both unit design and economy,0
"What really worries me is the changes on stage 4 and stage 5 damage, because these are going to linger and affect future sets, along with the bagsizes obviously which are staying due to pure ego",1
"These bagsizes clearly aren't healthy for the game without accounting for headliners, except if you can somehow make everything balanced which again with how units are currently designed it's not possible",2
First time in 5 sets that i havent grinded to 1k+ LP and i've been through 9.5 multicasters,1
"Also the set mechanic is fucking dogshit, not as an idea necessarily, but the encounters they picked are just bad",2
"If it actually offered choices to a player like the only 2 good encounters in the game ( cho and liss ) at the cost of something, then it would be the best set mechanic",1
"You can't just offer someone a boon, that's just boring, it needs to have some kind of drawback because you get skill expression",2
That happens because you can maximize the effects of your boons and minimize the effects of your drawbacks when you are good at the game,1
"And that leads to a very interesting effect of basically circumventing the stat generators everyone is using, it adds actual variety to a game and decisionmaking",1
"What you want is player agency, this set doesn't have that, the game is boring as a result cause you aren't even playing it.",2
Be greatful for the Dev team! I'm sure they will give more exciting and fun content in the future!,1
"If you position well that's not as much of a problem, Lillia's main problem right now is the same as backline access has always been",1
It's a noob stomper against players who don't know how to position but more balanced against people who do,1
didnt know mort thinks healing should be mandatory on backline carries? Because lillia is so good you need that.,1
Yone 2 was still really good for me on stage 3 this patch,1
I never went for 3 though and never saw anyone go for 3 as well so not sure how strong he was,1
Are these changes enough for Yone reroll be popular again?,1
tfw you finally get lucky paws to show up but it's your second lilia game in a row,1
Hope you’re right with Garen.,1
Good post bro keep up the good work 🥰,1
I think it's actually a different interaction,0
They both initially aggro onto Diana but Diana isn't a valid target,0
Voli had to walk forward to attack anyways so he moved immediately,0
Lee Sin wants to attack Diana but lags momentarily because of the Zephyr interaction,1
"By the time he wants to move, he has to go around Voli who didn't lag because of the open space.",1
I'm aware of that I saw it live,1
That's a good example of someone playing badly,1
I was just saying that taking morello when you have antiheal is not an egregious mistake and sometimes may actually be an okay play.,1
please remove lillia and azir encounters holy shit i get this fucking dogshit every fucking game,2
"mort mentions in the rundown that they want base garen to be good without storied champion...then why not nerf the augment instead of base garen? they're doing it for kobuko and lucky paws, so i'm not sure why they didn't take the same approach with garen

seems inconsistent",1
Just because that's how it is now doesn't mean he can just decide to not care about mobile,1
That's not even mortdogs job,0
Someone else would be managing that stuff.,0

"software doing this shit has been around for decades, stop making excuses for a billion $$$ company",2

"i'd guess protector's vow, lets him cast much earlier to taunt aggro off sylas/sett",1
"they only tweak numbers, can't even change text",0
"These stats only include what is considered active ranked accounts, meaning accounts that finished their placements",2
A single game wouldn't count for this,2
It is a better stat than no stats though,1
And no offense but that's what you are basing your argument on lol and yes an 800k ranked difference without a post - Arcane Boost and without augments first set boost is objectively enough to say that set 9 was a popular set,1
Set 9 had over a million more players than Set 6.5 had and even the trash midset of 9.5 that everyone hated only had a little over 300k difference compared to 6.5,2
You consider a million less people roughly the same? And this stat doesn't differentiate active player base,2
Essentially someone that queues up for one ranked game is counted as a stat,2
I'd like to see the numbers of games played on average in each tier,2
"If 6 million play but only play 60% of as many games that is statistically relevant wouldn't you say?

Average queue times are longer, especially at lower tiers",1
Gold and silver practically do not exist right now,1
I know you are using the best resources available to you and I'm not trying to start a fight,1
But I think most people feel the drop off in the player base,1
sitting on 20+ minutes queue time as an emerald duo,0

There are just better games to play atm,1
"Everyone knows it has been op for a while

Which 5 cost do we think is the worst to start with in Choncc's Treasure? I feel like Lissandra is pretty awful right now.,2
"Game updates delivered via cloud (including localisation overrides) have been a thing for over a decade.

"You can sort by ranked accounts per set including half sets through your stat site of choice my dude

Here's an easily summed up table for you though:

https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveTFT/s/S2drbM6BYH

I had it mixed up it was set 9 that almost had the same amount of players as set 6",1
"Set 10 was similar to 6.5 though.

Considering set 6 had the Arcane event + Silco and was the first set with Augments added it's actually kind of insane that Set 9 competed with it in playerbase despite not having those advantages and redditors constantly talking about how bad the Legends mechanic was.",2
Those were each half sets,2
Do you have the combined numbers or are you just making these stats up?,0

Sorry call me racist or whatever dont care won't do it,2
"Also with Riot embracing gatcha monetization after spending a decade as the golden standard of what free to pay should look like, I simply don't think I can support them anymore",1
"I've been one of morts biggest defenders, but him rubbing his nipples on stream Ala south park and openly mocking people with similar criticisms to mine blew up pretty much all the good will I had stored up",1

"What technical solution exactly? How do you keep cross platform play, abide by the appstore requiring a week for approval, and simultaneously have updates less than a week old? You **could** only do server-side updates involving number changes only but then you can't change version numbers",1

There are technical solutions to these problems,0
Riot chooses not to pursue them.,0
That unit is fake as fuck now,2
Can someone help me understand what does it mean for Galio the prereq is protector?,2
I've been primarily mobile in the past and forced to play mobile exclusively because my laptop isn't vanguard compatible,2
mobile players already have a piss poor experience with TFT,2
half the time they release a patch mobile client is late to update (last patch took days) meaning 10 min queues to load up with only mobile lobbies,2
wish he didn't use us as the excuse because it's clearly not working for us currently.,2
That’s fair enough and I apologize for throwing shade at mods when I don’t know the inner workings,1
"I’m sure it’s way harder work than I realize, and sometimes you guys do act on reports",1
My apologies and thanks for you work🙇,1
No? It's a buff to Infinity Edge which was one of her most common/best items even with the bug in place,1
It's a choice to keep cross platform as an option yeah,0
I highly doubt Riot wants to split the playerbase + the fact casuals can log off their computer at any time and just keep playing on their phone,1
(Or if Vanguard causes a tech issue you aren't immediately screwed since you can continue on the app while your computer reboots),0
It would still lag behind the meta by a week regardless of which day it released on,2
> We haven't had a particularly good set since Set 6,1
"The user base is slowly moving away to different things.

Meanwhile ranked playerbase numbers for the last 2 sets were higher than set 7 or 8 and last set's playerbase was almost the same as set 6.",2
I feel it is very unfair that they design the game for people who play 3 lobbies a week,2
It makes me sad because the people who want the game to work well the most are ignored and underestimated,2
I've been playing for a long time and I know the game will always be unbalanced,2
"What I can't conceive is that they don't respect the core mechanics of the game (big size, exp to level up) and modify them to try to satisfy what they think are the fantasies of casual players.",2
Reactions like this is why Riot balance thrashes so much,1
They can't just leave units in a good state while buffing the other options to hopefully be the same level lol,1
That can't be true,1
You must be missing some info,0
"Otherwise, how would they hotfix things within 24 hours?",0
We haven't had a particularly good set since Set 6,1
The user base is slowly moving away to different things.,2
"I agree with you that the negative feedback loop is insane and has definitely played a role in the slower activity around here, but there really isn't much we can (or should) do about it",2
People should be able to express their negative opinions about the game,2
They can be respectful and articulated about it and do so as a standalone post or in the Daily Megathread,1
They can meme about it and vent in the Rant Megathread,0
"They can even be complete assholes about it, but in that case they get suspended and their content gets removed",1
"And I assure you we do remove a bunch of abuse (as in more than just ""dogshit balance, it's a next set angle"") on a daily basis, especially when the sub is more active",1
"And believe me, when it's bad it definitely does a number on your mental health",2
I don't know how Mort (or any other public-facing figure in gaming) does it,2
This Set there were even a few new people hanging around with Riot flairs during the PBE cycle; watching them slowly get bullied off the sub was heartbreaking,2
"Still, we really try to do our best, so if you see anything you think has slipped through us, even in the Rant Megathread, please help us by reporting it.

I think you would be right with this statement a few weeks ago but at this point people don't care so the all threads are basically empty,1
This is worse imo.,2
I still miss the set 10 music,0

too much complaining and overall negativity in this sub,1
it really just turned into a place where salty people go to rant and complain about the game.,2
I definitely agree with 10 being incredible while 11 has issues from the start.,1
set 12 waiting room,0
True but it would mean tft player numbers going down which no one wants,1
There are benefits to having tft in the lol client even if it dies make balancing the game harder,1
Yeah it definitely feels like a next set angle.,1
"Set 11 is just not as good as 10 and it has been a while, so many are moving to other games til set 12",1
duelist is the most consistent S tier comp right now,1
Mort kept insisting on his stream that Lilia is at the moment as balanced as a 4cost ap carry can be,0
I guess he wouldn't touch her with that mentality.,0
Very interesting to me that 3* 4 costs are still way too common but people seem to just not care anymore,1
"The changes did absolutely nothing to stop it but I guess everyone, devs included, is just done with this set",1
China is probably having fun with it though so everything is fine.,1
This feels as if it’s the last patch of the set when everyone’s attention is on set 12 but it’s only halfway,0
Which is always great for a bit but casuals switch games fast while competitive gives you a core player base,1
Easy way to kill a game,2

"Constant damage and hp nerfing has made Lillia and morg easily kill backlines, has lead to duelist running over many comps without being able to kill Leesin, its just always complain to nerf nerf nerf

If you want to complain then complain that there are still many unplayable vertical traits, Fortune is boring right now, single target damage is low in many units, Yone and rogue is still unplayable, and there are many bad items in the game that have left untouched and many unusable Orn items while shop odds are leading to no variety in reroll comps or an annoying lottery on lv 8 and for some reason rolling for an uncontested unit is harder than just triple contesting",1
At least they aren't like league that they nerf a champion and almost never roll back.,2
i just lost with a lee 3 and full board of legendaries to 7 fated,1
just regular 7 fated with a 2 star syndra,0
"?????????????????????????????????? and not just one round, 3 straight at the end",1
is the balance really that shit wtf,2
Irelia crit fix with no nerfs to compensate is gonna be op isn’t it,0
"I dont get the ""familiarity"" thing..",0
"we are talking about a tournament, not Twitch.",0
"Agreed, it sucks that the TFT team has to deal with this severe limitation",2
Allowing them to be more responsive would make the game so much more enjoyable and probably boost player count.,1
"This sub feels dead af, it's sad.",2
Please nerf this Lee unit,0
Anyone else nervous that Syndra's gonna go from strong to being bad again,2
Dunno if the +10 damage gonna fix 1 less butterfly start,2
And 1 star maybe is fake?,2
pretty sure it's just find 6 run to level 9 insert better units,1
"And you only conditionally 3 star trist or voli, but the bigger thing is 6 duelist being good enough to go 9 in right circumstances",1
"14.10(b) nerfed trickshot from 60% to 55% and 14.11 undoes this, what’s the point?!",0
The trait was not even that op before 14.10,0
Nerfing Xayah was enough,0
I feel like they created more works for themselves.,1
Sort of surprised that Lillia didn't get a tiny nerf this patch (I mean like 5 or 10 base damage),2
"Also I wonder if that Garen nerf will be enough, hitting his aug feels like a free top 4, but early game he does seem to just barely survive to get one more cast quite often so it could be a strong enough nerf to the comp's tempo.",1
"They nerfed darius 1* and 2*, who is the main reason duelist are so strong early game",1
"Late game they are strong due high early tempo, but if darius is weaker, they should struggle a little bit more in late game",1
"I think Lee was a bit overtuned, but this is a good nerf I guess.",1
Are they doing the outdated thing of rerolling trist/voli? Part of the reason duelists are considered the best comp rn is because theyre strong early/mid but also cap high with irelia 2 and wukong,1
"There's also a lot of augments that instantly push the comp over the top like Keepers, support items, etc..",1
They're good at using random Ornn artifacts too,1
"Turns out, top 4ing consistently is still a good way to climb",1
How does duelist look even remotely strong? In all of my games they stomp early to get stomped late,1
"Seems like an unexpectedly light patch notes? Given how volatile the other patch notes have been and how how meh the meta feels, I was expecting some more changes",1
This is unironically making me beg for tft to get it's own client,1
Being forced to make balance changes 10 days in advance is leading to some real difficulties,1
No way they only touch up like 4 champs when half of the comps that used to exist are actually dumpstered,2
"Looks pretty good, I think the balance this patch was already pretty good besides maybe duelist/irelia being slightly too strong",1
"Now that crit got fixed on her, she's probably gonna make duelists even stronger so hopefully a B patch before too long if it turns out that way.

I think it will be a good patch other than that, though.",1
"Probably going to have to wait to see what the A/B patch is, can't imagine they don't nerf Duelists",0

"This is such a niche case now, but it's good to know wrapping is still here for a melee comp.",1
"Is it a 50/50 who steps forward to the space next to Diana between Voli and Lee, or does Voli always step forward because of some mechanic I don’t understand?",0
just leave lissandra in the dirt please,0
"Because Voli had a clear path to Neeko whereas Lee had to “go around” diana, then voli blocks lee’s path to Neeko -> Lee is forced on Morg

Could be wrong, this is my analysis and I’m fairly confident about it (this happened about 4-5 times this game and consistently in my practice for GSC)

I also believe that on the other side you’d want Lee in the corner instead.",2

"lvl 8 roll down never hit, i keep trying to avoid sniper wardens and the game keeps giving it to me and i always go bot 4 instantly how",2
“Clears”,0
"Thanks for the thorough response, I too thought Voli would go back line and it seems like in my games it’s 50/50 whether they wrap correctly or not",1
Maybe since lee was targeting the zephyr’d unit it gave just enough delay to let voli walk in front and force the wrap?,0
"That was Chinese casual endless bitching though, they changed Heartsteel cause the drop off in Chinese casual player base who wanted to see more omega cashouts",2
"I realize now why I just play front to back stuff, I don't understand melee positioning and targetting at all",0
How did the voli who is closer to morg end up on neeko and lee sin who had a potential target not that far away end up being the one to wrap around?,1
It's been boring but at least this sparks joy :D [ss](https://i.postimg.cc/5yLcPBvX/image.png),2
"Basically yeah.

Be sure to have enough other units on that side of the board as well, otherwise Lee is likely to just walk behind the frontline to punch them in the back, like Voli did here - personally I would just put Lee (or whoever you want to get to backline) in the second row to make it easier on yourself.

For example pre fight start I thought Voli was going to be the one to get into the backline for sure (2* taking prio in pathing?), with Lee row 2 it will be much easier to do correctly.",1

 The assumption is you will have a heavenly spat regardless, but if you are itemizing a Lee sin do you put the spat on him for extra stats or would he theoretically be better off with say an infinity force and the spat goes on a Diana or something  


> I think Heavenly emblem is still the better slam, especially for Kayn and Lee Sin which are the usual holders because they gain an added 17% crit chance and 17% omnivamp.

e.g",2
"from Heavenly 6 > Heavenly 7 due to emblem, you'll get 5% x 200% x 170% = 17 omnivamp vs 0

also I don't think you accounted for the increase in heavenly value in your calculation.

e.g",2
"If current board is heavenly 6 and you are given the option to get Tri-force and Heavenly emblem, if you take Heavenly emblem you'll go from Heavenly 6 to Heavenly 7",0

"Can't really tell by just the screenshot but didn't you just bleed out and die to Kayn after hitting at the end? Generally Lillia/Morgana does pretty well vs the comp too, they're pretty good at killing Irelia and Kayle",1

Maybe you mispositioned as well (Sivir ult on Irelia/Kayle is pretty impactful)",1
"Kayle cast can vary a lot in power depending on how she well she hits the frontline, too.

Like others said, itemization moved to Rakan helps a lot",0
"Rakan (or Wuk staff) + Irelia cast can actually kill backline which significantly changes the fight.

Finally, keep in mind that combat augments are more impactful for Storyweaver because you have an extra unit",1
"Generally I don't recommend going Storyweaver without hitting augments that strengthen the comp.

Hope that helps",1
The comp can struggle because it needs 9 but can't invest in econ augments to get there as much as other comps because it needs combat,1
There are more struggles such as a rough mid game (Storyweaver 5 sucks) and a rough lategame item distribution (Zyra becomes less useful and her items are kind of wasted) but generally the comp does decent at top4ing.,1

When NA challenger ladder is significantly more competitive than the first 5 days of these tournaments - something is wrong.,1
"I think (and I've found this is controversial, apparently) that there is a lot of potential in LATAM that hasn't been exploited mainly because of the previous format, where you wouldn't see any serious competition until you played almost 3 qualifiers",1
"Right now, a lot of the competitors from LATAM (myself included, unfortunately), haven't had as much experience playing in a high stakes tournament like Trials and Cup, and therefore, end up short",1
"I expect that, as we have more time with the current format and people get used to harder lobbies and more pressure, LATAM will start performing better as well",1
"I don't believe this means that, because NA had the stronger base when the format was implemented, that the growth in these regions should be stunted to benefit the bigger region",2
"That said, maybe something should be done to adjust the minimum rank (maybe masters, given top 100 in LAS and LAN is 90 GM + Challenger and 10 masters, always, because of slots).

As for the EV point, as someone else pointed out, it is at the very least exactly the same (0) or much better for LATAM players",1
"We used to play open qualifiers for 0 dollars, then closed qualifiers for 0 dollars, and then, after 36 matches, you could play for a chance to win something",1
"The previous NA format was better for them, but this is infinitely better for the region, and Im all for it.

As you mentioned, a combined Americas server is the answer for slot allocation, but it is impossible for this to happen as long as TFT is tied to the League ecosystem, and therefore, their region separation (BR/LAN/LAS/NA).",1

"but I genuinely had a super low Elo player griefing the ever living crap out of me in my 4th game, hard contesting me from a ridiculous spot and taking components/items that made no sense, like morello when he had red buff on completed item carousel",2
This was in tourney man,0
They had gone like 7/7/8 so they were done no matter what.,0
"1) Move Zoe items to Rakan at least.

2) Should switch out of 7SW slowly (no point w/o +1 or ways to power up Kayle)

3) Being stuck on 8 with those augments is bad",2
Especially on 6-5.,0
"Hey thanks for sharing your perspective, I didn’t know that about LATAM tournaments in the past - it’s good to know the new format at least improves the competitive experience for some people, I just wish it wasn’t at the expense of NA players",1
"I agree with a lot of what you said and that there are many good players from South America, my main concern is familiarity with these players rather than skill, but as you said hopefully over time this will improve.",1
That was what the game gave me :(,2
im supporting AD wants LBJ's D,1
I’m supporting pee on mi,1
It’s easier to make up the difference and surpass it more units you’re replacing,1
4 dragonlord is a big difference compared to 3 so the unit has to be good enough to make up that difference,1
"If u drop to 2 dragonlord; which isn’t that different from 3, you can spread the 4 dragonlord drop between 2 2star 5 costs",0
"This makes it possible to use most 5 costs viably (e.x.sett, hwei) rather than only synergistic ones (irelia, wukong).",1
You need to itemize rakan as a second ap tank instead of triple carry with 1 tank.,0
I don't think there's a single NA competitor that likes the new format,1
Several top NA competitors aren't even playing this tourney circuit because multiple tournies take up TWO workdays in a week,1
"For many people, they cannot drop their responsibilities to compete, nevermind that they will lose money if they do.

I think almost everyone would agree that not having tourney days on weekdays would be a good start, at least until there's some infrastructure in place to support making people play on weekdays.


I don't mind whether the players are recognizable or not if they're good..",1
"If they're good, they will become recognizable over time",1
"But South American diamond players? With the bag size changes and high variance of current TFT, you don't even have to be good (relative to the field) to win, but you can easily screw over someone (whether intentionally or not).

Also, I have doubts about Riot's vision for a large competitive scene when they can't even be bothered to setup a main broadcast for these qualifier tournaments",1
"Riot doesn't even care to build an audience for these pan-regional qualifiers, so what's the point of having big pan-regional qualifier tournies? Most people who watch them, watch them for their streamers, and guess what their streamers are saying about these tournies? They probably aren't nice words.",1
"I understand, from what you explain in your post, that these changes are not entirely appropriate for some NA players but I think that for the other regions that make up the Americas it is good and changing a couple of things the circuit could improve even more.

i am from latam and i would like to explain a little bit why this change in my opinion is better for us even though it also brings negative issues",1
"Starting with the good things, our qualifiers were not for money",1
We had a series of tournaments that rewarded the winners by giving them places for the next qualifiers without money prizes,0
Players only won money in the last stages of the qualifiers and it was the equivalent of a tacticians cup,0
There was also a league that brought LAS and LAN together in a competition,0
The prizepool was also similar to a tacticians cup,0
With the new format there is more money at stake for our regions,1
"The second positive point is that now there is one tournament per month, before you could do badly in the first qualifiers and you were left without competing for the rest of the set.

Bad things",2
Although playing against na players is fun and more competitive I think the rest of the servers are at a big disadvantage against them,1
Our queue times are generally 15 minutes and there are few times when there are more than 3 challengers in the same lobby,1
The practice is bad and the solution is to go and play na ladder,2
"The problem is that you also have to have a certain amount of points to qualify for the competitions and therefore it becomes quite tedious to have to rank up two accounts from scratch.

Regarding the trials, I find it unacceptable that we have only one day to prepare the patch",1
The last two tournaments had b patch on Friday and imo it feels pretty bad to play like that,2
"I know this affects all of us in the same way but I still wanted to mention it because it is something I think they should definitely change.

I understand your perspective, but there are also good players in our regions, although in a smaller percentage",1
As the competitions go by you will realize who they are and I think it will be a challenge to play against them.,0
I don't think sett 2 and hwei 2 are equal units without items,0
I'd 100% take out Janna or Diana for a sett 2 but never for a no item hwei 2.,0
Its super unit dependent,1
I'd argue that the stun and att speed are way more high impact than a sett 2 or hwei 2 that might get a cast off to do barely anything.,1
Thank you for ur opinion \^\^,0
Thank you for ur opinion \^\^,0
Depends on the comp and the 5 cost,0
Potentially though.,0
2* 5 cost are gonna be much better than trait and the trait bots,1
"So if you were to replace Janna/diana for Irelia 2 and Sett 2, it's an easy choice.",1
What about 2 star but without item ? Which do you think is better ?,1
An itemized 2 star 5 cost has more value than a no item Janna giving a board wide stun in most scenarios,1
"7 Storyweaver is the worst 7 trait in the game, in terms of average placement and winrate",2
I have complained about it many times but I think the devs just don't care or think it is fine as is,1
Kayle 3 is a terrible unit and needs buffs,2
Guys thats kinda awkward,2
"I got 7 Storyweavers, board hit",0
Got DECIMATED,0
"I know I didn't had combat augments (none came, most didn't had too) and my Kayle wasn't the best (was going for Zoe 3* then Irelia showed up naturally), but fully itemized Irelia 2* and Rakan 2* shouldn't have been a little better than those other boards? What could I have done?

I don't like it cause my biggest strength is rolling with the cards dealt to me,0
I think anvil buffet lets players who are bad at playing flexibly compensate by letting them to force comps,2
"Not that it's bad or anything, but I would say it is kinda a ""low skill"" augment.",2
"I heard someone mention the list on stream, but I don't remember the names, can watch GSC for starters, so many people hard force/commit to duelists without scouting, it's not even funny",1
Thank you for an answer rather than just insinuating I have no idea what I'm talking about when I was just commenting on my own game lobbies experience,1
And that makes sense from a flex play perspective.,0
"Perfect items benefits people who force a comp, so if you think a strength of yours is flexibility it probably makes less sense to take",1
"I’m not saying people are correct for doing so, or even that there isn’t room to play flexibly in Anvil Buffet, but I think that’s the reason it’s not even higher picked.",1
I hate it because a good player can work with almost any items,1
But with hero augments being so strong anyone who picks a hero augment just gets bis for fun and dominates the rest of the lobby,1
I'm generally cool with it tho cause it's a low variance portal,1
"You got any data for its pick rate in Plat lobbies? Your limited experience is not enough to make a conclusion on that.

Why is it troll? Why are other ways of playing the game lame? Just because you like it?",2

You got any evidence other than anecdotal that shows it is unpopular?,2
"Each unit individually; so having things like spark or shiv helps in stacking due to assisting in killing other units

"I don't think dishsoap is a good suggestion, I'd rather suggest someone, who hard forces 2 meta comps, then someone, who is cooking

Dishsoap is definitely worth watching and you will still learn a lot, but if try playing like him, while being diamond, you're going bot 4 most of your games",1
I honestly think this is a deeper topic and I’m willing to investigate further into it,1
"My argument is: frontline matters more than backline and 1cost pairs matter more than 3 cost pairs in general.

And trying to winstreak with Aphelios 2 is a fool’s fortune, sometimes your streak can be ended by lack of frontline or meeting some super strong mid game boards like Voli 2 or umbral spam",1
And then what? You’re down immense gold and now you can’t even go 9,2
It’s fine and dandy if you winstreak but it’s never guaranteed even with Aphelios 2,1
Aphelios 2 isn’t a mid game exodia unit the way Voli 2 is after all,2
"Just think about this: Caitlyn is probably better at dealing with fully itemized Voli 2 than Aphelios can, because Caitlyn is better burst damage",1
"Maybe the win gold is important, but you can have similar amounts of win gold with Cait 2.

Also, going 9 isn’t a safe play, you’re gonna get contested especially with Nautilus, which is a core unit in 80% of 4 cost boards nowadays.",1
A sylas or sett in front of udyr that ults before him completely messes with his dash direction,0
"Hello everyone! I've got 1600 treasure tokens, and what I want is a chibi(preferably a special edition like a prestige in the new rotating shop)",1
Is it more worth to use my treasure tokens now or after the introduction of the rotating shop in order to be more close to a rare little legend?(44 attempts till guarantee in the treasure realms),1
"Honestly, as long as you know what the strongest meta comps are, know what items to slam, have strong fundamentals and knowledge of how to transition into late game boards, it is really not that difficult",1
You have to play a lot of games of course but that's with any competitive game if you want to climb,1
Check out the tierlist for early game openers and mid game comps,2
I think the biggest mistake lower elo players make is they bleed out too much HP during the mid game because they are greeding their econ by playing really weak boards,2
Transitioning into your final comp then becomes too difficult because you simply don't have the HP to make up for the time it takes to stabilize your board,2
If you notice yourself losing rounds by 4-5 or more units sometimes it is the right play to roll down to 30 to strengthen your board,1

"BT LW means im hardforcing Kayn, Which is the worst 4 cost by far atm",2
"You should aim for high and settle for less than high as a back up plan.

No you never pivot Kaisa in that spot",1
It's better to donkey for one Ashe,1
I'll be honest most of what you are describing shouldn't be happening often; this sounds more like a fundamentals issue than set knowledge issue,1
"If you ask any high elo player ""what do I do in this incredible low roll spot"" they're usually just going to be in the same boat as you",1
"They have no magic way of escaping low roll, the skill is not ending up their in the first place.

"I think this set is much more flexible than something like set 9,8,7",1
It's really the encounters and odd patch cycles that are the issue atm.,1

Kai'Sa should not be available as a last ditch option as she need a lot of factors to make her work",1
"I'd rather be playing a weak S tier comp like Lee Sin than uncontested Kai'sa from a sub-optimal spot because at least then im griefing the other Lee Sin players.

  
I think AD is going to be slightly stronger next patch with 4 Trick, Kayn, Reaper Augment, Yone all getting buffed and Ashe remaining untouched in her broken state",2
I plan to make a flex guide then as it's a bit late now.,2
Wait actually metaTFT might have the vod stored somewhere on their site,0
I'll have to ask them to see,0
1st game of TC II,2
"Lobby 6.

I was fortunate enough to be invited to costream and watch the lobby so it might not exist as a VOD if Milala took it down",1
The other way you can get it is go to the co-streamers vods where we watch partied it,2
His name is Kai\_watanabe on Twitch,0
Unfortunately you will run into some trouble here as well as much like many other TFT streamers his VODs are sub only,1
"Great streamer tho so not all terrible if you this is your only route.

If anything I was thinking of making VOD review video on it so we'll see",1
Sub might get to it first.,1
If you can three star both I would always take Zoe,1
If you get right situation Zoe is loads more powerful,1
You need early kills high crit dmg and lots of ap,1
By mid fight she’s hitting multiple people at once for over 1k each,0
Plus to finish off two units near end of fight you get that long chain bounce split between them they do dead!,2
"Ashe Nautilus in shop on 2-5, long shot into sniper crest, into 8th because I still somehow never hit only slightly contested (2 units gone) Ashe 2 despite having an insane hp lead, gold lead from raining gold, and bis items?  Ok thanks game.",2

Just don't make yourself weaker,0
I see a lot of people make themselves weaker in order to follow a specific comp guide,0
"Never do that.

There's times where if someone didn't change their board at all between 4-2 and 4-3 they would have won a fight",0
But they sell all their item holders for no reason and play worse unupgraded units instead.,2
Hero augments must be such a pain in the ass for the team to balance,2
"If they are a bit too weak then they are unclickable & you are scammed off an augment choice, if a bit too strong it's insta top4 and that's fucking stupid",2
"Maybe they should stop making them but we all know they never take out systems, only add add add.",0

However if I was offerred aphelios 2 stage 2 I'm probably still always taking it if I have an item or two for it.,0

"10 Mythic, 10 Story weaver, and 10 Fated are way too difficult to obtain",2
It's very difficult to obtain THREE of the same emblems AND get to level 10 (baring new recruit) when you are most likely losing too much HP to streak properly,1
PLUS 3 heavenly is the superior choice because it's easier to obtain and win-streak with a strong board without ANY need to go to level 10.,1
"Hero augments post-set 9: Literally either absolutely horrific and un-takeable or is completely broken and turns them into an unfair, anti-fun 1v9 machine

Riot always bringing it back and trying to get the balance right but failing every patch is mind-boggling",2

How do you position around udyr? Even if I position by not putting my frontline on the far edge (which causes him to dash to the backline,1
My backline will end up walking up after he dies and he revives right on top of them,1
Most obnoxious shit I've ever played against,1

you misunderstand what flexing means if that's how you are thinking of the game,2
You should watch 15 mins of TC II Milala's first game where he has to stretch every 1g and play whatever the game gives him,2
"99% of people watching would say his spot was an 8th no matter what but he turns it into a 3rd and a possible 2nd.

"I feel like the devs don't care and don't play their game, Mort just plays in Plat lobbies or plays PBE",2
"No high level player other than maybe Iniko so they use streams and reddit along with some misunderstood stats and data to balance their game

they don't even bother to buff weak comps properly,2

"As a player in that elo, would you say that the reason they mess up on stage 4 is because of the flexibility issue?

Or would you say there are other reasons that people are throwing on stage 4",1
"Throw a master tier player into a game with 7 casual players and it’s going to be a stomp every time, there’s no challenge to it",2

It's even worse if you decided to build ad item and you locked yourself into 1-2 comps.,2
What do you do if you start with ap items and only get AD lỉke ashe/leesin on roll downs,0
And vice versa,0
"You started the game with guinsoo and last whisper, how do you transition into AP comp if you dont hit any ashe",2
"Do you go for the b-tier kaisa comp with those items.

Or what if you build BT and last whisper but never finds a lee sin after the roll down",2
"This set is so inflexible to me in that way, I often find myself in those situation",1
You are so incentivised to slam item early and there is only get lucky on the 4-1 roll down or lose,1
But there are also very little way to transition from those items,2
I think that is my main problem,1
"AP like lilia, syndra and morg are so contested sometimes, and it always happen when I play AP.

My favorite is scouting early, see that there is no one contesting sniper warden and the entire lobby slammed ap item, decided to build ashe item early, roll down on 4-2 and not hitting even a single ashe until 4-7

I got to diamond play sage/umbral/mythic/garen hero augment but I have had no luck with 4 stars comp",1
Every time I try those I loses,2
Especially duelist cause I never get leesin/irelia from the roll down.,2
"there was ad flex in set 10 because the lines shared similar units (sett, mf,…) but now i cant just full pivot from dryads to sage just because i hit a random sylas 2",1
thats too much money for a rolldown,1
i cant just hold sage or umbral units either because i need to make econ,0
this might save me from an 8th but i just dont see it being practical unless everyone tries this,0
"Any thoughts on AD flex options, especially at 8? My understanding of this patch is that you mostly only have sniper warden Ashe, with duelists if you use melee carry items/hit irelia and bruiser trickshot kaisa as a last ditch option.",1

the secret of volibear being a d tier pure AP item holder? sure to be a game changer in the NA meta,1

In that case not until day 1 or 4 of the next tournament depending on if he makes the cutoff for a bye.,0
"Dryad stacks stage 2 and 3 are a nice to have, but not required",1

Stage 4 roll downs are probably the trickiest thing to navigate in the game.,2
"What do you think about using kog + lillia at lvl 9 in the warden sniper comp instead of aphelios + syndra ?


Turns on mythic and invoker instead of basic fated pair (you lose out on the shred from aphelios tho but you can use lw on ashe and get a better secondary carry in lillia ?)",1
heres 8 gnars and perfect items,1
haha but you wont see the last gnar for 120 gold uncontested,1
"I was 50hp and the other player was 100hp, so why on carusel he was first to pick the item  before all players??? Happens 2 times in the game",2
Is this game breaking bug?,2
I miss playing Astral Nidalee,0
the main discord is pretty active and has a lot of high ranked players and coaches chipping in,1
For syndra how important is it to have been stacking dryad hp in stages 2 and 3? Is kindred 3 better than syndra 2? I’ve had a couple games playing fated opener where I’m on 7 kindreds by stage 4 but I usually swap her items to syndra,1
Should I just dig for a kindred 3 instead (let’s say uncontested)?  I get the idea of flexing based on the lvl 8 roll down but how do you handle swapping out the rest of your board? Let’s say I have a 2 star fated board and just need syndra ornn and sett but I hit a morg and sylas 2star,2
"Am I just playing these units until I find syndra or am I swapping out my 2 star board for a bunch of contested units like Diana, nautalis, Illaoi?",0
Currently d2 NA and it definitely feels like I’m losing my games in stage 4,0
I’ve typically been playing around fated and duelist,2
This post helps with the ap flex but duelists feels way less forgiving if you miss and a lot more important to get to 9 asap.,1
I don't know why they put these hero augments in the game,2
They're either gonna be too strong or too weak..,1
"People are forcing Ashe Porcelain or Syndra Porcelain even in Choncc's Treasure, lol hahahahahahha",1
I agree with your chart but it really just reminds me that this set feels so inflexible it’s getting boring rolling for a mix of the same late game boards,2

"Im in  plat-emerald, and the players sometimes can play decent openers, but after stage 4 they just throw the game",2
Like it doesn't matter that I missed in my rolldown they just messed their game up so bad that they are going bot 4 :D,2
Riot stopped doing their own streams starting this set,1
They could never pull in the viewers of Frodan or player streams,0
"EU is still doing official streams this set, but I believe this is their last one.",0
"I'm on a bot 4 streak where my items, units, and augments make the gameplan clear and my early + mid game is strong, just completely whiffing 4-2 and 5-2 rolldowns",1
"I min-max as much as possible and don't go 7th or 8th, but FUCK ME, there was nothing I could do in those games",2
"It's bad RNG, whatever, but it's so damn unfun",2
My wins don't even feel deserved this set either,1
"The game hands you a placement range: giga opener into 2 star 4 cost frontline and carries, here's your 1st-3rd",2
"Mid opener into rolldown with 1 star everything, dance for your 6th and like it",0
"""That's every set.""  Nah, even earlier metas this set had skill expression, comp variety, and outplay potential",0
This meta is the worst I've ever played.,2
Today I thought I will promote to diamond.,0
NOOOO fast 8th all day back to Emerald 4.,1
"Nicely done, wish I had this sooner!",1
As a coach I see players with a great early game suddenly start losing every round in stage 4+ because of their rolldown,1
"The biggest reason I can attribute this to is the lack of flexibility.

When you don't have knowledge of all your options and how to play them it is often far more tempting to go with the early direction you're are given on 2-1 and go all-in on it",1
For instance I see players have an early Ahri 2 opener on 2-1 and suddenly in their minds it's a Syndra game no matter what,2
When in fact there is ZERO incentive to play Syndra here over any other AP comps,2
"Sure if you had perfect Syndra items or even a Fated augment there is a case, but if you're basing your direction on units that can be replaced by hitting the d key once and hard forcing a B tier comp then you are not setting yourself up for much success.

Hopefully this graphic can help with staying more flexible! I used to have fast 9 as an option but in this patch it's better to stabilize as early as possible due to hero augments taxing you for 20 a stage, 

Let me know if you have any questions",1

You are supposed to pivot out by stage 5 unless its one of the good ones like the ashe annie one where you can add 3 exalted as your 9th unit,1
"Unironically ahri2 can outdamage syndra2 and its very strange.

Just making simple ‘damage potential’ sim of syndra hitting a target dummy and ashe hitting a target dummy should prove how wildly imbalanced these two units are compared to each other.",1
"During most of the patches in Set 9 you could play for a 4th place like that, even in GM lobbies like I mentioned.

Regarding highrolling carries, during Set 10 you could spend gold to reroll a Corki board and hit everything you could hope for",1
But Corki fell off so hard as a carry that itemizing him and spending any amount of gold to reach 3\* was a missplay,2
"It's just unintuitive since he on-the-surface looks like a carry with good traits.

I'm not saying that a 1-cost carry like Corki should be able to win a lobby without ridiculous lategame conditions, but he shouldn't be a guaranteed bot-2",1

42% from South American players Vs 56% from NA is more what I was expecting,1

"During Set 9.0, apart from the yasuo+kaisa patch, there were a huge amount of comps that were playable",1
It was generally better to stick to the meta but even the weakest comps(such as Maokai+Viego reroll) could top-4 in GM lobbies if you highrolled hard enough,1
"This is what I'm missing in Set 10 and 11.

During Set 10 I had repeated experiences of getting punished for playing comps I highrolled for, such as Corki reroll(which was literally unable to top-4 for most of the set)",1
"The experience of getting punished for thinking intuitively(highrolling a carry = good) made me quit the Set early, as I think the game is ruined if you have to rely on meta-guides and tier lists.

This experience has followed me into Set 11 and is why I think legends should make a comeback",1
"It would allow sets to not always, but at least more consistently reward different gameplans",1
"For me, I want to be able to play Urf(even if he's suboptimal) because he has the power to make bad comps playable",2

Yeah I would like some more statistics and less bombastic words,1
But the post made me curious so I looked up how well the regions did,2
"From eyeballing it, it seems like 24 out of 57 South American players qualified(42%)",0
Meanwhile 40 out of 71 North American players did(56%),0
"Breaking down the South American regions further: 

Out of the 19 LAS players, 7 qualified(36.7%).

Out of the 27 BR players, 14 qualified (52%)

Out of the 11 LAN players, 3 qualified(27%)",2
"Generally speaking NA does a lot better than SA in E-sports, but today it seems like, based only on qualifications, BR was not far behind",1
Pleasantly surprising to see them do so well.,1

"I don't mean to discourage you from writing these posts — I think any reasonably high effort TFT content is always good for the scene.

But at this point (more than halfway through to regionals), I think we all sort of are in agreement that 1.) NA is currently the best performing region in the Americas, and 2.) the competitive format this set is clearly not ideal.

Continuing to make it out to be a big deal that NA is ""clearing"" and ""dominating"" the field with each successive tournament day isn't really adding much to the discussion imo and is moreso just beating a dead horse, so to speak.",1

>Similar to the principle of Aphelios is Zoe,0
"Here, I compare her with the currently popular four-cost AP carry Lillia",1
"The combat power of two-star Zoe and two-star Lillia is actually not much different.

>So why is the ""3.5-cost champion"" more cost-effective in comparison? First, it provides smoother transitions",1
"Second, it can roll at level 7, extending its strong period.

>Look at the stage diagram on the right",1
"From 3-5 to 5-1, compared to the traditional four-cost AP carry, most of the time is Zoe's strong period.

>Additionally, it is much easier to get a two-star three-cost carry, and in the late game, chasing a three-star is not significantly less beneficial than leveling up to nine in an 8-4 composition.",1
"Yeah so what don’t you understand then? Aphelios 2 is better than Ashe 1, if you get Ashe 2 before aphelios 3 then you transfer items, you just wanted to state the obvious to sound smart or..?",1
"Yeah the guy who translated it hasn’t played a 3 star because he actually read what he translated, and played accordingly, at no point in the entire guide it says you should play for a 3 star as your win condition, just to be open to it and set yourself up for when the opportunity comes, to disagree with something you first have to understand it, maybe read the guide again?",1
Here's a fun fact,1
You can agree with some points someone makes while disagreeing with other points,2
"Noting that 2 star 3 costs are perfectly playable and better to itemize than 1 star 4 costs is great advice for lower ranked players who hyperfocus on some end game board they saw on a stats site.

However, advocating for consistently rolling for a 3 star 3 cost or 2 cost to round out your board while on level 8 can be detrimental to those trying to learn as well",1
"There are absolutely spots for it, but if you tell a lower ranked player to go for the line of finishing off their 3 cost, they are going to sit through all of Stage 4 and most of Stage 5 with 3 items on a 2 star 3 cost and possibly 1 item on a 1 or 2 star 4 cost depending on the stage",1
"They're going to get absolutely crushed by anyone who has 3 items on a 2 star 4 cost and be worse off for it.

Notice how the OP went to the trouble of translating the content but if you look at his last 20 matches, he hasn't played for a 3 star Aphelios or Zoe a single time",2
"It's pretty much always use that early power to push for 9, not stay on 8 and finish off a single unit.",1
"Thank you, got it xD.",0
Dude the guide literally says to put items on aphelios 2 instead of ashe...nowhere it is stated you should roll for aphelios 3..,0

Usually LW since you can cheese sunder from other sources (evenshroud or LW on another backliner next to her),2
It is also common knowledge that you can transfer items to a better carry so then what’s the point is saying that then? You are not hitting a 3 star for free the same you won’t hit a 4 cost 2 star for free,1
You don’t need a reroll meta to hit a 3 star 3 cost either,0
"Many people will be playing 3 costs on their boards, like illaoi, Diana, volibear, tristanna, Zoe and Aline are used in other meta comps so there will always be a lot of 3 costs out of the pool for you to hit",1
"That being said, no one said you have to play aphelios 3, just don’t be afraid to itemize him and hold copies since you never know, you can sometimes even hit aphelios 3 faster than Ashe 2 since it’s rng, will it be every game? No",2
Should you be open to it and willing to play it? Yes,1
"Even tho it’s common knowledge to use item holders, there are a LOT of people putting items on an Ashe 1 and then wondering why they went bot 4",2
So I think the post and the long explanation as to why and how to play it has its merit,2
"Coming here to act like you guys know it all and talking shit to op like he is in the wrong for posting and translating a guide from someone else, it’s pretty lame, specially since there a lot of newer player that come here for help and can use the info, the funny part is most of the people complaining and moaning “common knowledge” or “basic concept” and masters peak at best",1
"If you think the post is “too basic” then maybe it’s not for you, keep scrolling, no need to cry about it",0
Might need some advice here,0
I keep getting like an 8 or 10 streak for stage 2/3 and then bot 4ing,0
What usually happens is I have last pick on carousel and it’s an encounter/artifact one but my choices are pretty bad for what I’ve already committed,2
I just feel at such a disadvantage when someone gets a BIS artifact and I don’t,0
Sometimes it’s just normal items being bad as well from being last pick,2
I think I might not be rolling deep enough on stage 4 either,0
It feels really weird to winstreak the whole first half of the game and then feel like I have to roll to 0 on 8,2
"Going 9 even from high HP seems really inconsistent, especially if my items are bad from being last pick like I said",2
Any tips? iI was GM last set and stuck in master right now,1
"I feel like the meta is kind of bad right now and being flexible isn’t rewarded but I’m trying to focus on what I can actually improve.

I don’t know if I should just stop trying to winstreak since it doesn’t seem that valuable right now",1
I can easily bleed out to 0 starting stage 4.,1
"Seems to perform way better in lower elos than high, imo it's viable but unless you've literal BIS augments to make kayn tanky enough I'd rather pivot into duelists if you manage to hit a single irelia at 8.",1
Pretty much always been like this as far as I can remember,1
"AD is ""usually"" stronger on 4, 5, 8 and AP has 6, 7, 9",2
"Of course this is just the general design of TFT sets and not a hard rule, and a lot of times it doesn't end up working out like that due to balancing",1
"Duelist/Challenger throws a (welcome) wrench in the mix too when it's in the set, usually following the same power curve as AP",1
"There isn't a whole lot to learn from this aside from ""roll on 6 if you're weak playing AP"", which isn't even really true anymore with bag size changes basically forcing you to hold onto your gold for dear life so you don't miss uncontested (you still will)",2
"In past sets it was a lot stronger (Astral Nami, Multicasters, TD Senna, etc etc).

I might be cooked though, I'm just a guy that speedruns master and quits cuz I'm incapable of playing the same game for very long",2
Big dawgs please correct me if I'm wrong.,2
"Just took an uncontested 1st on ""Kayn ends game at stage 5-4"" encounter because I hit recombobulate with three 4-costs on stage 3-2 into a free win streak till 5-4",1

">1-star 3-cost is weaker than 1-star four-cost

>1-star 4-cost is weaker than 2-star 3-cost

>2-star 4-cost is better than 2-star 3-cost

>3-star 3-cost is better than 2-star 4-cost.

This has literally been common knowledge for at least 8-9 sets now",1
The thing is that you can't just tell the game to let you hit the 3 star 3 cost out of thin air,2
"Statistically if everyone is going for 4 costs, then you're not going to hit your 3 star and now you're stuck on the 3rd line getting blasted every round in Stage 4.

The result is that unless you're already in a 3 cost reroll meta, your 2 star 3 cost is still being utilized as a transition unit, not as your primary.

The person you responded to said that ""the better play is always gonna be switching items to ashe"" and you replied with ""Not if it’s aphelios 3 that’s the point.""

My point is that you can't just hit the Aphelios 3 for free",1
"So his line of thought is correct within the context of the patch.

Alternatively, let's consider the Ghostly Zoe strategy proposed in the OP",0
"It suggests that you hit the Zoe 2, go 8, and then hit Zoe 3 or Zyra 3 as your carry",0
"However, let's say you hit Morg 2 while you only have 5-6 Zoes",0
"Chances are, if you sell your Zoe and move items to Morg 2, you are going to save at least 30 hp on Stage 4 and 5 compared to if you held for Zoe 3",2
"The question then becomes, are you going to win out on Stage 5/6 in exchange for that 30 HP?  If the answer is ""No, you're going to lose to a capped level 9/10 board and lose the rest of your HP"" then the highest EV play is to just swap carries to Morg and then play for 3rd or 4th from that spot",1
"This comes with the chance of going 9 and slotting in a Hwei/Azir 2 to put those items on instead if Morg 2 itemized stabilizes you enough.

Unless a ton of other 3 costs are out of the pool, such as in a reroll meta, moving your items is going to save you 2-3 placements over deciding to hold out for that 3 star 3 cost on level 8.",2
"When do you give up 3 star illaoi for 2 star galio? Say you have 6 illaois at level 8, and you're uncontested",0
"If you roll down 30 gold without a single copy, do you give up? Or do you hold out more hope for a couple more rounds if you're healither?",1

If you have snipers focus for ashe do you drop IE or LW?,0
Just read the post again man I can’t understand it for you,0
"Yeah but that means the guide boils down to ""Just hit the 3 cost 3 star with reduced bag size and no 3 stars out of the pool 4head.""  It's a strategy that only works if everyone else also decides to do the same thing with different units",2
He's just describing a reroll meta,0
"When Yone/Alune reroll was meta early on, you hit your units and then slotted in Kayn 2 and gave him leftover items because obviously you weren't selling your Yone 3, but this is far from revolutionary tech.",1
"I mean, we did have a few patches where 3 costs were dominant enough to go 9 with a 2 star 3 cost but that's just not the case anymore",2
"You have to either hit the 3 star 3 cost or use the 2 star to transition to a 4 cost.

For instance, the guide recommends Manazane on Zoe",0
Zoe 2 has a 4.72 avg in Master+ and a 4.92 avg (+0.21 delta) with Manazane,0
"However, Zoe 3 has a 3.29 avg with Manazane (-0.36 delta from Zoe 3 without)",0
3 star 3 costs outcapping 2 star 4 costs and in turn being outcapped by 2 star 5 costs is just a fundamental understanding in TFT,0
"However, it's ridiculously hard to hit that 3 star 3 cost unless 3 cost rerolls are meta in general so that everyone has a higher chance to hit",1
"Unless you know you're going to hit the 3 star, it's absolutely still a transition unit because selling the 2 star 3 cost and playing a 1 star replacement copy to move the items to the 2 star 4 cost when you eventually hit is almost always going to be better than slowly putting the leftovers on the 4 cost throughout stage 4 and 5",1
If you're sitting on Zoe 2 carry on Stage 4 you're just going to bleed out and die.,0
I just played the event with 10 Storyteller and won against a 3 stars 5 cost,0
Is that right?,1
"Every patch this set has had a B patch, and I genuinely believe this was worse than 9.5",1
"That’s bc at least urf forced variety of verticals, but this set has like 3 playable comps at a time at the top level of TFT.",1
"I dont know, my board always gets SO much stronger when playing 1star ashe instead of 2star aphelios or switching items to her",1
She can carry Stage 4 with other things in line while aphelios cant,2
"At least my opinion playing sniper ashe a lot since last patch.
The whole theory is true IMO, but the one example with ashe and aphelios just feels completely different in my games.",1
"> the better play is always gonna be switching items to ashe and get a replacement aphelios, and any other items you have you’d rather put on your sett  




It’s exactly what he said.",1

"They need to make re roll comps more stronger, I played mythic kogmaw reroll had 4/6 units 3 star and was pretty strong until people started hitting 2 star four costs and 5 costs and then I managed to squeeze out a top 6, I’ve won the lobby before but that was with double mythic spats and had 7 mythic in and got level 9, but that win con is so hard.

To be honest now I just turn my brain off and go Ashe or Irelia, Ashe generally can easily top 4 and Irelia can normally win, but it depends on early game",1
"Ashe is also super contested at the moment since it’s easy, I remember hitting a Ashe on 2-4 so obviously I’m going Ashe at this point",1
5 other people in lobby also forced Ashe and we all hand held to shit placement.,2
I want to hit master so bad this set but the second I get into d2/d1 I feel like I shit the bed,2
Just had a game where I had an insane Ashe line,2
Another guy fucking recombobs Ashe 2 while another one naturals Ashe 2 in the same stage,2
I go eighth.,0
"Wait is heavenly still viable? I had emblem (from augment) on lee with titans and bt, had every heavenly unit upgraded (I know that doesn’t affect anything anymore, just mentioning that my board wasn’t 1 star), had silver healing orbs and inspiring epitaph as my last 2 augments, had antiheal and shred, I didn’t hit rakan or wukong on 8, so I just played a random kayn 2 with good items, would then replace him on 9",1
So I was flexing between 2 and 3 dragonlord because no rakan,0
"I had lee 2* kayn 2*, but I lost every single fight… by the time I got to 9 I was 1hp",2
I was at 60hp (around 4th in the lobby) at 4-2 with a good amount of gold and hit everything at 4-5,1
Just felt like the most undeserved 7th I’ve ever had,1
ty,0
I think this has probably been my biggest struggle climbing,0
Before I thought you could stabilize a bit on the 8 roll by hitting a single 4 cost but it does feel like you need to two star them to at all stabilize,2

This is the worst patch imo,2
"You either hit a hero augment, or force a top tier comp",1
"If you force a top tier comp, someone else in your lobby likely got exodia for another top tier comp",1
While others exodia’d hero augments; and you go bot 4,0
Better just pray for good augments or its bot 4,1

"Each Ghostly unit spawns 2 ghosts, one time",0
"The first time Morgana attacks 5 times, she spawns 2 ghosts, and that's it for the rest of the fight",1
Attack speed isn't all that important.,1
I was so excited for this set to end in 4 days then read we just have a second TFT pass incoming instead,1
"Just give us set 10 back.

This set feels like it is taking forever and without a mid-set to shake things I wonder how many people are going to drop off",1
Curious how this set is doing concurrent player-wise compared to last.,1
If you're uncontested then you have a higher chance of hitting with lower bag sizes lol,1
Increasing bag size literally makes this situation more likely,1
"Shop odds on the other hand could help, but it's not significant.",2
"Finally reached my first ""hardstuck"" in Plat

I came back to the game about a month ago and quickly climbed to Plat, made it all the way to Plat 1 30 LP and since then bottomed out and have been bouncing back and forth between Plat 3 50 LP and Plat 4 50 LP.

I'm not exactly sure what I changed up or if it was meta shift but I can only blame myself.

Started tinkering a bit trying out different strats/styles and nothing has worked for me.

Really just wanted to get out of Plat and call it there but can't even do that.

Anyways that is my sadrant",1

I have no idea why you're downvoted as you are completely right.,1
Can’t 1 star 4 cost actually be the same if not better than 2 star 3 cost given strong frontline and in consideration of the traits being played,1
"In stage 4, a one star 4 cost carry is enough to be stable as long as your frontline is upgraded",1
I don’t think it’s right to compare strength between each cost in a vacuum.,1
