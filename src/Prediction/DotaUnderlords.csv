The invite is expired is there a new one?,1
"If artifact had been 1% as good as paper mtg, let alome BETTER as you claim",1
The game would still have a huge community,2
A 100% rng game will never be better than mtg,2
"You should always consider that Valve had several meetings regarding the Artifact fiasco, I'm sure they have learned from their mistakes",1
"Also, Dota Underlords is a successful format with active players, this make things really easy for them since it's their specialty.

I have full confidence that Valve will deliver this one \[only if it's not P2W or has a price barrier\]",1
At this point I just hope that Valve will learn one or two things from the failure of Artifact...,2
Here we go again!,0
I just want us to get a couple months into Underlords so I can stop seeing people shoehorn in conversations about artifact all the fucking time.,2
Artifact is not a better mtg on paper,1
It's worse in everything,2
Or else people would play free draft,1
"There's no semblance of balance, some cards are objectively superior to others",1
Sinergies are few to non existent,2
Which could help with the above point,0
The rng is through the charts,0
"Arrow rng helps you loose well planed games, and win bad games",2
Neither situation leaves you happy,1
Games take way to long for a card game,2
Plus the most greedy monetization ever implemented in a video-game,2
And wotc will never abandon paper mtg,0
It generates way to much money,1
The digital card game helps extend that market.,2
We thoughts exactly,1
"And less Rng, don't bring artifact mechanics here",2
Like arrow rng,0
Or other innovations,2
The only change I'd like to see its a set number of drops for each npcs wave,0
Where I can choose what I get.,0
"instead of paying 30$ for this game, I'd rather play the VERY polished and well made from Drodo & Dragonest.",2
"to all the idiots who think b2p is good to mantain servers:
1000 players forced to pay 20$
or 
10000000 players willing to buy cosmetics",2
"After all of the issues with Artifact, I find it pretty hard to believe that they won’t do right with DotA Underlords",1
"This game fits the classic Valve model far more than anything else, and I can’t wait to see where they take it.",1
I hope they’ve learned their lesson from introducing an overly greedy monetization system,0
"Having to pay each time you wanted to play can be such a huge deterrent, especially in a casual game",2
"Free to play with paid cosmetics would be ideal, exactly like Dota.",1
"Artifact had initial cost AND pay to win features, so you really never know what you'll get with Valve.",1
Well they really need to maintain servers and the cost of engineers,1
People would pay $20 if its a good game (pubg was 30$),1
Whatever keeps the pay2win feature away i believe.,0
Didnt think a price tag for an originally free to play  custom mode is fine though,1
Remember it became popular due to a massive initial playerbase,1
Setting a price tag isnt that good of an idea imho.,1
"An initial price tag on the game is fine, the real problem comes when its pay2win, or even pay to unlock more modes",1
"That said, a $20 or a $30 price tag is fine.",1
I like where this is going,0
Looks like it’s Auto Chess boys :D,0
My prediction/hope: vr title where we control thousands of units like an RTS,0
"Multiplayer, and cross compatible with pancake screens",0
Give it to me valve,0
"When we got info about artifact, it was said that in mid 2019 it would have a mobile version, so thats my bet.",0
The name is fitting with an RTS in the way you described,1
"I want to say VR RTS/RPG/FPS.

RTS - you’re a commander and delegating troops / heroes / resources

RPG - cooperative dungeon crawler similar to the style of diablo or maybe an elder scrolls (elder scrolls less likely but it would be cool af)

FPS - Deathmatch where everyone is capable of killing each other in a showdown of a few seconds",1
Buying items along the way,0
Maybe a common objective that grants game winning status like killing roshan and getting super buffed.,1
Dota VR RTS/RPG/FPS,0
"I want it to be an Auto Chess, the auto chess currently is a mismanaged unbalanced mess...

But with this name I don't think it is...",2
