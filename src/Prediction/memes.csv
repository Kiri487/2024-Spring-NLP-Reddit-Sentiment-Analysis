And I think she got hired because of her father is a well known professional weapons person in the industry,1
Also I'm fairly certain it's Alec Baldwins production company or he is at least an executive producer.,1
The issue is that Baldwin is not at fault at all and you are saying it‚Äôs partially his fault.,0
"Not a failure, you are still alive despite all odds",1
That‚Äôs a victory,1
It's the fact that Steven Universe isn't liked as much by the same demographics that belong to the other projects...,2
"Man, I used to have a bunch of ‚Äúwatch later‚Äù playlists like that - but YouTube started handing out account strikes for playlists at some point, and I ended up getting two strikes on my account within a week.

He wasn't just the actor who pulled the trigger and while he has no responsibilty for as he was under the assumption the gun is cold but he was also one of fhe producers and them were adamant on combining the armorer and props assistant jobs and continuing the production even after two accidental discharges before the fatal one.,2

They aren't forgiven",0
At least not by the main cast,1
"They are forced to basically dismantle the foundations of their empire, but at no point does anyone on the main cast actually forgive them",2
"In fact, they are show to explicitly have no remorse for what they did",0
"They're just good guys now, but don't really understand the meaning behind all the new changes",1
Steven is explicitly uncomfortable in their presence and wants to get away from them at all times whenever they're around,2
"The difference between ATLA, and SU is that the plot never gives Steven a way to actually beat all the diamonds permanently by the series end.",0
Two words: Jevons Paradox,0
Increased resource efficiency will more often than not increase consumption of that resource rather than decrease it,1
"That also applies to labor, that's where the ""automation creates more and better jobs"" meme comes from",1
"AI will not be the end of us, the same things that are being said about it were said about previous automation technologies, every time it was predicted that everyone would lose their job and the system would collapse, but every single time the excess labor was successfully reallocated to other fields",1
You forgot the Last Of Us 2‚Ä¶.,0
A lot of real guns are used on movie sets,1
"It's important for anyone handling a real gun to know basic safety measures, especially since accidents can and do happen even when firing blanks",1
Just ask Brandon Lee,0
"Even though one person is ultimately responsible for ensuring the safety of the firearm (the prop master), actors should know the basics to prevent accidents like this",1
"This accident was the result of a chaotic and disorganized production, which is ultimately the responsibility of the producer",2
Live ammunition should *never* be stored near blanks and every gun should be checked by the prop master before being handed to the actor and should only change hands through the prop master,1
This accident was a result of lax safety culture at every level.,0
"The white diamond is the closest thing to a literal god of their species, she did not lose the war, she decided to give a new way of life a chance",1
