Well… you‘re partially right and partially wrong,2
Of course limiting every device to a single standard isn‘t great,2
But: in a lot of cases companies create their own charging port for the sole purpose of being the only one who sells the power adapter,1
Just take a look at most small electronic items (especially electric razors / trimmers / …),1
I‘ve got a box full of cables and adapter purely because if I loose one of them I‘d need to find the specific type  from that manufacturer,1
And there are hundreds of different options,0
Hell… my dad has the same type of electric trimmer I have,0
There‘s virtually no difference between them,0
But one is a bit more recent and thus they have incompatible charging ports,1
So if one of us looses the charging cable we‘d have to buy a new one even though the other trimmer needs the exact same V & A,1
And that‘s obviously not okay,2
But good luck trying to get a micro USB / USB C / … trimmer,1
"Especially for a similar price.

So I‘m totally fine with 2-3 standards for certain kinds of electronics, if a new and better standard can still be developed and potentially replace an older one.

Regarding easy to remove batteries… Again: unfortunately nearly every significant smartphone company glues the battery to the phone / makes it inaccessible without a lot of tools",1
And we‘re now at a point where every component has to be „id coupled“ to all of the other components,2
Don‘t get me wring: for storage and security features that‘s fine,1
I wouldn‘t want someone to be able to use my storage in another phone to read my data,1
But my battery doesn‘t have significant data,1
So why do I need to pay the manufacturer to couple my battery to the rest of my device if I‘ve already got a working battery? And given that the battery is the first thing that fails replacing the battery is the most common thing people would want to do,1
Like… I‘ve got really old phones and they‘re still working great,1
But their batteries are fucked and getting the batteries replaced would cost more than the devices are worth,1
Obviously due to water resistance etc,2
I don‘t expect the old way of just removing the cover with a fingernail and switching the battery,1
But the way it‘s currently done is meant to keep people from replacing batteries by themselves and to increase the cost of replacing it professionally,1
Which is nonsense but it works because every significant manufacturer is doing it,1
And lastly: software… That really hit a nerve,1
I do like iOS,0
It‘s a nice operating system and even though I‘d like the option to customize it more I‘ve had a few iPhones over time,1
But as a developer I‘d really like to get my own apps on my phone and to load other apps I want but that I can‘t get from the AppStore,1
And given that the phone is my property I should be able to do that,1
But for „security reasons“ apple has refused to allow people to load other apps without having to deal with really annoying hurdles & buying a mac and / or their Apple developer license,2
I‘m not a child anymore,0
Give me the option to install Apps you haven‘t checked and I won‘t blame you if I install malware and fuck up my device,2
But again: Apple doesn‘t do that and there is no second iOS,0
The only alternative would be a really custom Android version and then I‘d need to find a matching phone for it etc,1
which is really annoying,2
"(And there are a few features I need / like that only iPhones have…).


So while I do agree that the EU tends to overregulate (especially with idiotic stuff like the new copyright laws) these new rules are a few examples of when government intervention can be useful",2
I do believe in a mostly free market and technically I‘m fine with some monopolies (like Apple with the iPhone & iOS) but if monopolies exist they need to be regulated more than other companies would because the ability of the free market to change it is limited,1
You can‘t just recreate iOS because then you‘d get sued by Apple,0
So until Apple allows other to modify iOS it‘s essentially a monopoly and thus other rules apply,2
Especially to things like the AppStore which was the only App store you could use.,0

"I really doubt it, at least nothing that's as hassle free as doing it ""acoustically"" 😂😂 look all I'm saying is I've had very little trouble getting off with my hand or a partner consistently, I can get there with a toy as well, but nothing I have experienced with one of those toys has ever been like ""i can totally end up only being able to cum this way"" like it can be the way I've heard some women talk about their vibrators or whatever.

Long story short, I was completely not at fault regardless of my speed (other driver pulled in front of me and came to a complete stop) so I was sueing the other driver for pain and suffering and my lawyer said we could’ve gotten more but unfortunately I told ems that I was possibly speeding",1
"He said never admit to anyone even medical personal anything, unless it’s specifically medical, but I was just in a car accident and they were asking how fast I was going, I thought it was important medically but he said ideally I wouldn’t have told them that and just said I don’t know, but if they ask where it hurts then tell them.",1

"There's a nationwide electronics store that does it and has been doing it for a very long time in Australia called JBHiFi.

You must show your receipt and let security look in your bags so they can make sure you've paid for all your electronics",1
"It's not like it's hard - the person who checks you out puts your items in a bag and hands you the receipt, so you only need to show them the receipt and hold the bag open at the door for the security guard.

Like I said, that's been their policy for quite a long time, we all know that's how they do things so if anyone objects to such a practice I would assume they would just shop somewhere else",2
There's no point whatsoever in going into a store with this well publicized practice and then having a temper tantrum when the security guard treats you exactly the same way as they treat everyone else,1
You won't get anywhere and the cops won't come and arrest the guard because you interpret store policy as an 'accusation' that you stole something without any proof when it ISN'T that at all.,2
you can't really have any opinion on something you know nothing about.,1
My regret as a man is not buying a sex toy sooner,0
I'm glad we finally now have a meaningful selection of pleasurable devices to use,1

"Also - the “hot n ready” pizzas and dishes are thrown out (discarded) really quickly, so you will get a relatively fresh dish when you go there",1
The discard goes to the employees (thank you),0

"Patriarchy doesn't mean men are behind everything? It's about the general relationship between different genders in society, shaped by material reality, cultural background, etc.

Decades ago women couldn't vote, open a bank account, only real control they had was who they show affection to",1
"In short, women generally give sex, men generally receive it, and while nowadays materially we don't really live in a patriarchy anymore, culturally it's still ingrained in society as your parents and other older generations either grew up in the timed where societal roles were much more enforced, or they were raised by parents with said views.

Hence partially why generally male masturbation is seen as pathetic (failure to get a woman), while female masturbation is generally seen as empowering and liberating.

Now, how does the toys objectifying women part come into this? I don't know, I'd confidently just say the women that said it were both stupid and ragebaiting for views as everyone with a podcast does nowadays",2
There's not much more to it,2

I'm guessing this could be because of how it is less accepted for men to have sex toys, so they improvise instead of getting a real toy that wouldn't get stuck inside.


But on this subject and women: There was a girl at my school, when I was in my teens, who used a hot dog and she accidentally broke it and while panicking about it or something she ended up pushing it upwards(using the front door) and couldn't get it out since she was so tensed up because of it, so she had to go to the hospital and get muscle relaxers or something.",1

Adding files to a repository is like one of the most basic fundamentals of git",1
"Don’t do this stuff in the UI, it will only confuse you more by abstracting how it works even more",1
"As a software engineer, understanding basics of git is a requirement if you ever want to work on a team of developers.",0
Ironically I did just that and they told the cops,1
And according to my lawyer it was perfectly legal and I shouldn’t have said anything.,1
One of the worst shows ever made.,2
Every time I eat it I get stomach pains that wake me up in the middle of the night and I sit on the toilet for an hour in agony,2
I think it’s something in the dough.,0

I'll still take their pepperoni cheese bread any day though!",1
"I have no idea, but there's a trend with people generally seeing slutty women as disgusting and men who can't get partners as disgusting.",2
As a massive fan of the show i agree so much,1
"That little shit is the only bad thing about the show for me.

  
Rest of the characters are awesome tho , especially Georgie and George Sr",1
Been a while since I heard that,0
I remember everyone saying he was one when the show got a new Steve,1
That was ages ago though,0

"Some, not all, but some religions really hammer down on sex because it's a form of control",2
Followed by a method to gain more followers through closely controlling people into starting their own families and pumping out as many babies as they can,1
"Given in some religions it's taboo or considered heresy to use contraceptives, similar to how it's heresy to use toys that allow for the spilling of seed as some put it",0
Given it again boils down to some religionS want all that baby juice to only be pumped into a woman as disgusting as that sounds,2
"Mormons are a very good example of this, in which a common theme for a lot of teenage and young adult Mormons is to use marriage as an outlet to satisfy their sexual needs",1

Followed by inna typical religious fashion sex is highly controlled by the church to try and pump out as many followers as they can,1
"Religion can be blamed for a lot of the fucked up laws, stigmatisms, and taboos that exist within society",2
"It's all about control from the public point of view, and non public point of view.",0

I respectfully disagree,1
Family can stay any time they visit and I'd extend that to friends too,0
I'll say  with friends I'm a little more particular,1
Close friends yes,0
Casual friends maybe,2
Acquaintance no.,0
Lmao we’re about the same age,1
That super (and perhaps the first to overuse it) auto tuned dO yOu beLiEevE iN LifE aFtEr LoVe song had me sure she was 70 when I was a kid watching MTV,1
"Coupled with my parents telling me stories about her and Sonny Bono, I figured she was born during the depression.",0
It is deeper than that.,0
And the cleanup is a pain in the ass,2
I even own an autoblow and as nice of a walk as it makes its loud and not discrete in the slightest,1
"I have a partner now so I wouldn't use it anyway but my hands can get me off faster, more reliably and silently",1
Nice backhanded complement I like it,1
I couldn't agree more,1
"I moved back home with my parents last year and, for no discernable reason I can find, this has become my dad's favorite comedy show lately",1
"However, I hate it with a passion, to the point that whenever he turns it on, I literally can't stay in the same room because even just hearing it in the background while I'm on my laptop or whatever just pisses me off.

I mean, why tf am I going to find a show funny when its single, unceasing premise is ""smart kid, meet regular people""...?",2
Fr,0
Where would someone even hide that? Why would they have that? That's just absolutely disgusting,2
"Do they just take ""him"" in the bathroom and wash him off after? What the fuck?",2
I'drather have great gameplay rather than good or stylish graphics,1
That's probably why I love Rimworld,1
I hate big bang theory but love young Sheldon!,2

These are confounders and you can’t possibly control for everything even in the same person.,0
Nope,0
A suction cup isn't the same as a life zised doll.,0
More amazed that they had him make I through life and never get his ass beat at least once,1
Both actors were great but God damn everyone in life would hate him,1
Where only a few people would get along with his ego,2
Most would at the very least prank and try to be cruel to him for the sake of how he acted.,2
It grosses me out so much,1
Was the Xbox 360 1080p? I thought it was 720p with an upscaler,0
Thank you very that is great advice I do agree I do this not only on Reddit but Facebook Instagram and I usually go back and then edit everything because it's just easier that way you know what I mean sometimes I make it before somebody says anything sometimes I don't all good man I don't really hold any hard feelings I just like to mess around with people I think everybody's great I love everybody and yeah you know we all have our own special unique characteristics and I love everything about everybody even you my friend even you,1
If everything is fine then judging and looking down is also fine.,1
This was posted last week,0
Toys are a joke,0
No wonder you live a miserable life,2
"Pleasure should be between a man and a woman not a machine !!
If you are not pleased enough just do it the natural way.
Do not program yourself on toys because gradually you’ll be fully dependent on them and lose romance.",1
"Mfs that try to be ""alpha"" and think that all a woman needs is the piss poor sex provided to them",2
The same ones that see it as intimidating or competition rather than a tool.,0
Vanilla is shit,2

what's the point when a game needs 2.7TB for GrApHiCs,2
3 tb hard drives for 2 or 3 games? no Thanks,2
Games need to have less money poured into them,2
"Indie games are incredibly popular despite the low investment, why do ""AAAA"" games need to be pumped full of everything and called a ""cinematic experience""?",1
Huh? Literally never met anyone with such a toy.,0
"I felt like the conversation was more about opinions from outside of a relationship, but sure, partners can have one too!",1
name one.,0
What? You have strange acquaintances.,1
Yep,0
"South Park is absolutely a great example of ""how to get away with being offensive legally""",1
Sometimes the way it turns when it's inside can prevent you from pooping it put because it gets stuck,0
"Also, sometimes the toy may pierce a hole in your intestine and get lost in your abdomen, not very pooping friendly",1
"Lastly, sometimes it can get way too far high for you to poop it out effectively, your anal sphincter and pelvic muscles are very low you know, and peristalsis cannot help you move a forearm-sized toy from your intestine to your butt",1
"Bonus thing, to get it out you have have multiple people rummaging through your butthole before they attempt surgery",0
Those people are generally males (surgery is generally male dominated) with quite big hands,1
"I'm a (female) med student and well, I did see an extraction",0
"Interesting for me to see, not very fun for the patient.",1
Tubi + Freevee is objectively the most economical way to stream movies,1
Duh.,2
What about Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory?,0
I'm not saying you're wrong about anything but there's difference there's a difference between God and what the Catholic or any biblical teaching that have been manipulated by men represent that you know it's two separate things,2
It's not right or wrong you're not winning anything you didn't prove anything I'm just agreeing that I don't agree with what teachings are taught but I do believe that there is a God a greater being or multiple gods,1
My lovely friend,1
Rubber vagina? No issue,0
"Continuously talking about it? Certainly issue.

Child sized sex doll? BIG ISSUE.",0

"Well, in that  case people should use them as a defense all examples covered if South Park already got away with it because of winning court cases A lot of people could probably be safe from being canceled",1
Why not go even further and use a headlamp from when fire was the source of light.,1
If they can make a robot that can move and feel close enough to the real thing,1
Goodbye sex outside of breeding 😂 the planet would struggle as no one having kids,0
I think it's just too corporate now,0
Too much money goes into it and they don't wanna try new things,1
They need a return on their investment,0
"I was born in 93 and maybe kids nowadays feel differently, but that's just me.",0
"??? Old post I know but when? Its peak was late 80s to 90s and we didn’t access to the internet in this way just that aol late 90s maybe 🤔

I know we had loud obnoxious moms who attacked the show over Bart’s behavior which I assume is why he’s treated the way is now",2
He was what caused the Simpsons to be a hit over all though,0
"The reason modern day Lisa is so off putting at times to Bart from the audience is they always treat her as a Queen and is always right, it used to be at least treated equally in the classic episodes now it’s like “Lets dump on Bart even when he doesn’t deserve it” Matt needs to have a balance here.",1
While reading the comments I realized that the thing that's absolutely disgusting is men talking about it,2
"If I ever found out by somehow accidentally evading a dude's privacy that he uses toys I'd be ashamed of myself, and probably wouldn't think anything of it",0
"However, if some dude just announced that he was using them I'd probably gag right there",1
Same with women,0
Please keep sex talk at minimum unless its with your consenting partners,0
Most people Don't wanna hear It,1

Yall might find women talking about it hot but most women genuinely don't think it's hot when yall talk about it,1
Please stop.,0
Important distinction that not all traffic stops that result in tickets are arrestable offenses,1
"In Oregon, for example, most speeding stops are just violations, and aren’t considered a crime that you can be arrested for.",1
Well a properly made sausage (not the ones you get from a supermarket) is always going to be better than a unflavoured unseaned steak,1
Considering you can put herbs and spices into a sausage I'll say it's a no brainer.,0
I’ve never had to tenderize meat,0
"I know it can be done and has some benefits in certain recipes and preparations, but it’s absolutely not true that “most meat needs to be tenderized”.",1
"https://learngitbranching.js.org/

This site is pretty useful",1
"Once you get the hang of pulling and pushing, which is around 5 commands max, you will be fine",1
You can learn the rest as you go no problem.,0
"I have one and have used it like 3 times, because I live with room mates it’s an effort to warm it up discreetly, then have to lube the toy and myself which is messy",1
Then it needs cleaning immediately and try cleaning that and airing it dry discreetly and you bet cleaning it leaves a silicone and lube smell in the bathroom,2
All this in a house full of people,1
When lubed up it also makes too much very obvious noise that anyone walking past the door in the dead of night would hear,2
It’s just not a practical tool.,0
"Yep, this is the answer",0
"For women, sex toys are seen as a choice",0
"For men, they are seen as their ""only"" option",0
"Don’t really care enough to change the name but yeah, I’m only skimming post while having a cig In the dark outside, so yeah, it’s straining",2
That aside If you’re gonna write that much You gotta do it like any good book and grasps the reader’s attention with your first few sentences then go on your tangent and rant and people will probably read it.,1
also commenting on your own post with nobody else answering,1
Makes people stop reading too lol… well good job on that one,1
I read the whole thing.,1
This is so true!,1
Sure buddy,1
I wrote a big ass research paper on free speech using South Park as one of my case studies,1
"They have amazing lawyers AND that disclaimer at the beginning , which saves their asses in a brief nutshell 

I wanna see the scripts BEFORE the lawyers made them change stuff",1
lol 😆 I bet those scripts are insane lol,1
"If someone told there is a cucumber in their ass, would you really need to ask how they got it there?",1
"No, but they are linked to longevity, for example, shorter telomeres are linked to cell senescence, higher risk of disease, genomic instability and lower longevity",1

"do you know if there is any decent documentation or youtube guides to get you started with the basic workflow of it? I have looked and havent been able to find anything that is either easily understandable, or works for me..",1
"I dont know what works for me yet which is a major part of the problem.

Is there an App that takes care of everything for me so I can move into the cmd line when I am comfortable? or do i need to use the command line?

  
I find official documentation is amazing for when you have already got your toes wet, but is highly highly confusing when you have no idea what your reading.",1
I'm really surprised one of you real big tough people tough guys tough girls whatever you are I didn't pull the old block the account and then you know choose the person of something that's not true at least you're taking the conversation and going with it like you actually have a pair like you have a pair good for you or all of you good you didn't block out and b**** out yet,1
"We call it toxic pizza, but god damn I love a slice of their cheese pizza.",1
Americans dont know how to use tofu,0
Amazes me how little pushback they get,2
You see things getting canceled for much less,2
Did a little research it didn’t seem like there was like crazy good lawyers or anything really note worthy that explains how they get away with everything….,1
but I’m glad they do,1
"rather not play fallout or red dead with ""cartoony"" graphics, thanks",1
George Lucas actually discusses this on the New Hope commentary,1
The sandcrawler vehicle actually got stuck in the sand and made for a huge time-sink with already limited time to film,1
"Also, Luke is somewhat based on Lawrence of Arabia, where the main villain is literally the desert.",1
"Oh cool, what kinda flashlight did you get? I got a Pelican 7600, which is a bit expensive for what it is..",1
"But since it can do white, green, or red light and has a wand attachment, I used it at my old job to marshall aircraft",1
