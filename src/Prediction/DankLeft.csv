Awesome thank you,1
I've got 'em,0
They're from Ben Gurion's War Diaries and other sources,2
"They're useful because the ahistorical narrative you see on Reddit for the '48 war (""We came in peace and they attacked us"") isn't supported by the primary sources - which is why they don't quote any",1
"The war had been a long time in the planning and had set objectives: 

>""after the formation of a large army in the wake of the establishment of the state, we will abolish partition and expand to the whole of Palestine “
— Ben Gurion, p.22 “The Birth of Israel, 1987” Simha Flapan.

>“We must do everything to insure they (the Palestinians) never do return.”
David Ben-Gurion, in his diary, 18 July 1948, quoted in Michael Bar Zohar’s Ben-Gurion: the Armed Prophet, Prentice-Hall, 1967, p",1
"157.

>“Let us not ignore the truth among ourselves … politically we are the aggressors and they defend themselves… The country is theirs, because they inhabit it, whereas we want to come here and settle down, and in their view we want to take away from them their country",2
"… Behind the terrorism [by the Arabs] is a movement, which though primitive is not devoid of idealism and self sacrifice.”
— David Ben Gurion",2
"Quoted on pp 91-2 of Chomsky’s Fateful Triangle, which appears in Simha Flapan’s “Zionism and the Palestinians pp 141-2 citing a 1938 speech.

>We must expel the Arabs and take their places…",0
"And, if we have to use force-not to dispossess the Arabs of the Negev and Transjordan, but to guarantee our own right to settle in those places- then we have force at our disposal.”

>“It is very possible that the Arabs of the neighboring countries will come to their aid against us",1
But our strength will exceed theirs,0
"Not only because we will be better organized and equipped, but because behind us there stands a still larger force, superior in quantity and quality …the whole younger generation of Jews from Europe and America.”
Ben-Gurion, Zichronot [Memoirs], Vol",1
"4, p.297-299, p",0
"330-331.
See also Teveth, Ben-Gurion and the Palestinian Arabs, p",0
"182-189

>""From your entry into Jerusalem, through Lifta, Romema… there are no Arabs",0
One hundred percent Jews,0
"Since Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans, it has not been so Jewish",2
In many Arab neighborhoods in the west one sees not a single Arab,1
"I do not assume that this will change… What had happened in Jerusalem… is likely to happen in many parts of the country …in the six, eight or ten months of the campaign there will certainly be great changes in the composition of the population in the country.”
(Ben-Gurion, War Diary, Vol",1
"1, entry dated 7 February 1948",0
p,0
"210-211)

People will try and discredit these but you can even find them cited in the work of Benny Morris and quoted in the Jerusalem Post.

Another fact omitted is that the Arab armies that came to the aid of the Palestinians were outnumbered 3 to 1 and poorly equipped - many of the surrounding counties were still under European colonial occupation after all",2
They never stood a chance realistically.,0

">Would I have to leave, even though I have lived here all my life, as have my parents and grandparents? 

I have never heard anyone suggest this other than racist conservatives who use it as a narrative to discredit support for Indigenous sovereignty",2
"You should be extremely critical of where these narratives are coming from and cautious when you repeat them, as it gives them perceived legitimacy.

Land back is not about colonizing in reverse",2
It is not about kicking white people off the land,0
"It is about decolonizing the people on the land and their minds first, disentangling from colonial frameworks and re-centering all the other worldviews that came before and survived through colonization.",1

"Yeah it makes more sense to provide for people who need it, regardless of their ancestry",1

None of us chose our ancestors,0
"Someone else doesn't have more of a right to live here than I do.

And this is another contradiction among some of those on the left for land back",1
"They simultaneously want to be welcoming to immigrants and refugees but then pursue literal nativist policy and thinking, except the group is shrunken down to be only people of certain ethnic groups, not just people born here.

Plus, who does each plot of land ""belong"" to?  Do the Black Hills belong to the Lakota or the people who they kicked out only a few decades before the Americans kicked them out?

Palestine was actually my introduction into land back movements more broadly,1
I still remember being a young and angry kid wondering what can be done about Israel’s oppression,2
"I found that effective decolonization actually starts with decolonizing one’s self, one’s community, one’s area and region/local governments, and finally one’s country",1
In that order,0
Only then are we in a position to effect the decolonization the world over,0
Without this we are simply screaming at jackbooted thugs paid to ignore then beat us.,0
Good response.,1
"Greatest recommendation in a day, thanks",1
I've never heard of landback pushing for socialism,0
If they are that's fantastic,1
The US is already deindustrialized though,0
Mostly anyway,1
Factories and the like are elsewhere for the most part,1
Not much manufacturing here (at least relative to the past),2
"Historically deindustrialization is a bad thing too, just look at the rust belt and see how its gone",2
Ofcourse any socialist project in the US needs to provide national liberation to the many oppressed nations in this country,1
The US is a prison of nations,0
You cannot just give any single nation massive sway but you can create a way to balance their interests in a proportional fashion,2
Also if the US were to be socialist it would immediately be put under trade sanctions by the rest of the world so it would need to reindustrialize quickly to defend itself.,1
"So many questions here, I'll try my best to answer them all.

Landback isn't suggesting we give ALL power immediately to the indigenous people, this is unobtainable and unrealistic both in America and Palestine.

The material conditions in Palestine are so bleak, today we focus on fighting for a ceasefire",1
"In the same way here today we fight for indigenous rights, our own ""ceasefire"" on our whitewashing and cultural erasure",1
"Today, land back just means supporting indigenous people.

But, land back recognizes that real meaningful support alone won't be enough",1
"We then must dismantle capitalism (America and Israel respectively) so that we can do things like deindustrialize ancestral lands, and allow them free housing, healthcare and education first",1
"Later on down the pipeline, we will need socialism, as to offer true democracy",1
The best part about socialism is that it is a science but not an exact science,1
"How we go about paying reparations, and reforming society will be up to us and really, only time will tell",1
"But they will get **significant** representation and power.

But landback does not demand displacement, it's just not feasible under these material conditions.

We will welcome and accept their culture and people with arms wide open, we will build museums to preserve every single shred of what is left, we will pay reparations, and we will grow together as brothers and sisters into communism, together.

It's important to always remember that to the priveledged class, equality feels like oppression.

This may seem like a lot, and it is, but it is also **the only path forward**",1
"#YES

#FUCK THE USA 

#GIVE IT ALL BACK",2
Or the fact that different groups don't agree who owns where so in reality the most powerful tribes are probably those who'd get the most say and the best land while the others continue to suffer,1
Also like,0
North America is huge,1
"There aren’t enough Native Americans to form a society covering most of it, forget actually using the land.",1
"Like, I understand giving more support to indigenous communities in the US as they are absolutely atrocious with them being studied by the UN for extreme poverty (the kind where basic things like food and clothes are unaffordable), giving them more authority to actually control what happens to their land as its super common for the government to build pipelines without their consent through it, etc.

But I don't even know what the Landback movement wants",1
"Free Palestine is crystal clear, end genocide and give the Palestinian people their own country back",1
Simple,0
Nothing vague about it,2

I am a Canadian of European descent and I am confused on the specifics of giving land back and indigenous sovereignty,2

I've tried to figure out Land Back's goals but still cannot,0
"Can you please explain them in a non vague way? The most I've seen was ""native stewardship"" but with no explanation of what that means in a more practical sense.",1

Homes exist independently of the existence of landlords,0
Show me a landlord who built the home.,0
wait is this sub unironic in being devoutly christian?? I feel like I remember that being a complete joke when the sub first started?,1
Ok genuine question here,1
What if you’re basically just letting people live there for the price of covering the utilities and costs of the building themselves,1
And not really caring what people do and not caring too much about collecting “rent” other than to cover the costs of the building,2
Not line your own pockets,1
"And not evicting people, unless they’re like doing genuinely dangerous things in the place like making bombs or meth or something? Yes ideally everyone should own the place they live in but in our current system is it not acceptable to provide cheap and affordable living space? This is a genuine question that has occurred to me",1
There are a lot of bad places to rent and a lot of really shitty landlords out there but I’d like to think that you can still be kind and giving to people while renting property,1
Yes in a non capitalist system where we do have good public housing and people are taken care of it’s not something that should be needed,1
But in our current system If someone kind doesn’t own the rental property it’s just going to get bought by an asshole or corporation who is not going to take the best interests of the residents into account,1
I dunno it just seems like to boil everything down to blacks or white is belittling the situation and ignoring the circumstances,2
But that’s just my thought on it,0
What do you guys think?,0
True,1
For a human he kinda dumb,2
More of anarchist I'd say,1
I don't recall any part of the Bible in which Jesus praises bureaucracy.,0
"I liked that one he's admitting that landlords are claiming a right reserved for God, but engages so little with the meaning of the words that he can't see it.",1
"remember, in gilead they only tell you the parts of the bible they want you to hear.",0
"Remember kids, American Christians are usually American first and Christian second",2
They just fundamentally can't accept that aspects of the culture of their country are inconsistent with Christianity.,1

Where is that from? Maoist anime? 😂,0
"If Jesus became President, half of the country would want him crucified again",2
"Most folks who live under capitalism have no curiosity about whether it’s actually a just system of living

Top comment AHHHHHB,1
These people want to follow Jesus up until their American programming kicks in.,0
Look I am an atheist but I know very well that it is easier to pass a camel through the hole of a needle than a rich man enter the kingdom of the heaven,1
"Like I think you maybe could rent your apartments at or below cost or something, but noone does that and no one will do that lol",1
"Those comments are literal dogshit haha.

""Um actually my last landlord was a christian and he was super nice when he reaped all the equity for allowing me to give him half my income""

Stockholm syndrome.",1
I think I'd be less hard on Christians if they practiced what they preached more often.,1
My headcanon is that the “Christian Apocalypse” is not the end of the world but just the end of Christianity,0
"If Jesus of Nazareth were alive today, his biggest fanatics would decry him for being poor, brown, Jewish, and socialist",2
"The hypocrisy of most American Christians is absurd, I hate seeing those super rich mega church pastors, and televangelists",2
"Jesus was indisputably a wise man, even if you don't believe he was divine, such as I, an atheist; compassion for your fellow man regardless of their background is a good thing to teach",1

"""It's as easy for a rich man to enter heaven as a camel can walk on a needle""

(Nailed it)",1
"If you study a little about it, the bible is actually a very progressive book",1

"But all that part, extremely precise, about how to use and lend money..? They don't mention it, casually",1
Blows my mind how these people claim to follow a man that told them to give all their belongings to the poor,2
"His condition is brain damage from benzo withdrawal-induced coma he suffered when in ""treatment"" somewhere in the Balkans.",0
"Jesus was, of course, famously a big fan of the rich and powerful.",1
"THIS

So much this",1

And then Fauci appeared on news channels to defend this decision, not as a public health decision, but because it’s what’s best for the economy?

And, with reinfections, long COVID becomes more likely?

What a great way for the bourgeoisie to make the proletariat less of a threat! A literal bioweapon that they didn’t have to develop or deploy! They just had to sow the seeds of distrust in public health.

Too easy.",1

The lore of Fallout definitely leans anti-capitalist though,0
The games heavily show that just about every pre-war corporation was evil,2
"Hell, the TV show heavily implies that Vault-Tec started the war just to test their products, and various other major corporations were just as complicit in the Vault experiments",2
"There is definitely a heavy anti-military industrial complex theme in the games.

>Thinking to the famous phrase, “it’s easier to imagine the end of the world, than the end of capitalism,”

The lore actually perfectly fits this quote",1
"Capitalism didn’t end, the Vaults were a continuing capitalist experiment, even 200 years later, the show blatantly shows this with the Vaults.

It’s certainly not like, some extremely Marxist take on capitalism, but it’s certainly anti-capitalist overall.",2
"Every major film or show that’s anti-capitalist had to be approved by capitalists for distribution into movie theaters, tv channels, streaming networks, etc",1
Otherwise they’d be relegated to YouTube or something that doesn’t require approval,0
"Prime has The Boys, a quite explicitly anti-capitalist, anti-American (ish) show",0

The whole point of the game is an evil corporation and a fascist government used people as living experiments against their will and ended the world in a nuclear apocalypse.,2

Isn’t the whole series as a whole the exploring of what would happen if the world ended but capitalism didn’t?,1
"I'm like 99.9% certain that the only pieces of media throughout the entirety of human history that are more overly anti capitalist than the fallout series have been the assorted literary works of Marx, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao",1
And I'm quite positive that I have no idea whatsoever how people are missing that point,1
The states has such a desperate need for preferential voting but I see no push whatsoever to try to change it,2
"Liberals, you are the ultimate Trump supporters",0
"You trying to silence all criticism of Biden and telling them that they have to vote for the genocidal fuck under the, let's be honest: **fucking false** pretense that Trump will ""genocide harder"" (No one is a bigger shill for Second Hitler than Joe Biden",2
"**No one.**) when you could instead be pressuring the DNC to kick Biden's ass out and replace him with someone that won't cost them election.....

"I'd even say it does a pretty good job at making a systemic critique of capitalism instead of the usual ""capitalism is bad because bad people are in charge and we just need to put good people in charge."" You kind of have to dig for that interpretation though since the vast majority of old world leaders are just kinda shown to be out-of-touch, devoid of empathy, and generally unlikeable.

The games on the other hand are more complicated",2
"Because they're RPGs, the player has a choice in how they interact with the world, so it's difficult to have a central theme or message",2

Well we do know they split sometime between the finale and the bombs dropping in the pilot because one of the people at the party comments his daughter is there and he’s working the job “for alimony.” Him being a celebrity I would wager that’s said because a divorce was made public,0
So it could be she knew it was happening but couldn’t do anything getting her daughter from Cooper without tipping him off which might leak everything to the public if he whistle-blew,0
"Seems like there’s a lot of potential they could do with the situation, but I still personally think she wouldn’t risk her daughter being outside the vaults if she knew it was going on, whistleblowers be damned.",1
The Boys is very anti-capitalist as well,1
I don't think Bezos is worried.,0
Not the first nor the last capitalism critical series Amazon releases and hosts on Prime,1
"Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they shit out a documentary about how billionaires are bad at this point",2
That's a good point about her wanting to guarantee cooper and their daughters safety,1
"If it turns out Vault-Tec did drop the bombs, I wonder if there will be a plot in the second season where it's revealed that Cooper took their daughter and left after overhearing the meeting",0
God I love that song,1
My personal strategy is to openly tell libs that I’m not voting so they feel pressure and worry over it but then to actually vote,0
So far a few people I know are pissed at me for this but are aware of my criticism so I think it’s worth it,1
And got your ass out to the protests too I hope.,0
no what the fuck is fallout,2
"In the Vault-Tec meeting Ghouls wife suggests guaranteeing a nuclear apocalypse to the room by dropping one themselves, but it’s never explicitly stated if they actually did it",0
"As a counter my friend had a pretty good point, if his wife actually did know Vault-Tec was going to drop bombs as she suggested, she’d probably know the when and most likely wouldn’t have her daughter with Cooper outside the vault when that happens, which I think is a solid argument that Vault-Tec didn’t actually drop the bomb",1
"The games left it intentionally vague how the bombings started, which I prefer",2
Personally I hope there is never a canon answer to who started dropping the bombs.,0
"Imagine the conservative heads exploding if they didn't pull their punches on ""the good guys"" being communists.",1

Can’t you feel my heartbeat ?,0
Wait are you serious?,2
Idk “greed” is always a red flag for me in otherwise anti-capitalist media because it implies they’re scapegoating the failures of capitalism and not interested in directly addressing the actual problems,2
“It’s all because of some greedy corporations” or “companies are evil” sound nice and left-leaning but they usually are just shying away from legitimate socialist ideology to a safer “bad eggs/apples/cops” argument,2
I’m not sure Fallout necessarily fell into this trap but you hear a lot of it in episode 9 when the aforementioned meeting occurs,2
"Lots of “we’re not commies, we’re just not crazy” and “I’m a loyal American just sticking up for the little fella” when ideologically they should just be communists lol.",1
"I was just going to ask, have *you* played the game? How is fallout *not* a critique of capitalism.",2
"So many libs on here seem to think that saying ""the blue guy isn't much better than the red guy, we should push him to do better"" is the same as ""I'm going to vote to put the Cheeto back in the white house"".",1
One counter point is that the Chinese first strike narrative could be deceptive propaganda.,2
"There’s that too, but I was thinking more about them not shying away from the psychotic greed of the corporations.",2
