"It's about as true as what qAnon cultists want to believe.

I decided to participate and they asked me about a million questions as to what tobacco products I use,0
I use none and instead of asking if I used any at the start I had to say no to a ton of things I didn't even know existed,0
Started to feel like a weird marketing thing to inform me of the varied world of tobacco,2
"Anyway, they finally asked 'what political party I identify as'",0
I say none and before I could even clarify that I while I don't belong to any party but that I vote Democrat they hung up,0
No 'thanks for you time' let alone a 'goodbye',1
It felt really like they were trying to juice whatever poll they were trying to conduct and when they didn't get the answer they wanted about party affiliation the call was 'disconnected' so that I could just be fully excluded from their metric.,1

"Oh forget it, it's not like you actually have even the most remote semblance of some far-off idea of intellectual curiosity",1
Let's talk about how smart I sound.,1
Unfortunately  this is one of the biggest issues in (especially large) democratic systems,2
"Guaranteeing people the right to choose allows them to choose against their own interest, which a significant portion will inevitably do",1
"Combined with the people who actually want to intentionally misuse power for their own benefit they form a sizable voting block and can ""democratically"" do whatever they please as an effective tyranny",1
"Restrictions on public participation are similarly difficult to implement in a ""free"" system because allowing the government to determine who can participate in politics/public discourse etc",2
allows them at the same time to determine who can't participate,0
"As a hypothetical, the prohibition on traitors holding certain offices seems good and reasonable but it also allows the government to restrict a person from office by declaring them a traitor",1
"If this hypothetical government even once finds itself in the hands of people who would declare, say, a rival political party or some ""troublesome"" minorities as traitors then it's all over.

In this way both guaranteeing and restricting freedom of participation are merely stopgaps on a government's inevitable slide towards authoritarianism.",2

Generically, for the most part, all of the leaders of political power in America agree on most high level ideas",1
"Even the supreme court which is currently making decisions one party dislikes, generally is in lock step with most of American politics.

Biden won't stuff the supreme court because the DNC uses the heritage foundation for ideas just as much as the GOP and neither party has an invested interest in stuffing the court st this time",1
With that said the democrats are at least courting the idea and have been since Trump left office,2
"Biden has not nor has he ever been a proponent of radical changing systems to deny the GOP a fascist pivot for the country.

"While I have good reason to be skeptical of any justice served out for Trump, I don’t have the same pessimism as you.

For me, the most compelling reason to think they proved the case is that Micheal Cohen admitted his wrong doing and got 4 years",1
"He has never wavered from the fact that he broke the law, at the direct request of Trump, AND the paper trail of payments confirms both his admission of guilt, and Trumps guilt.

I don’t think there’s a single doubt that Stormy got paid off",1
"She had the literal receipts from the checks and there is no plausible explanation for her being paid $130k right before the election by Trumps lawyer, except that she was a hooker with a story to tell….which she’s told the jury",1
"The other thing I’ll say, is that from what I’ve gleaned from people who reported on the case and were in court that things like Stormy’s testimony resonated with the jury",2
They laughed when she made quips or clapbacks against the defense and they apparently paid intense attention when Cohen was talking,1
"I’m struggling to see how a jury member could look at the criminal fraud conspiracy of Trump and cohen, and the separate them to say Cohen is guilty Trump isn’t",2
"A final thing is that the jury wasn’t sequestered, meaning they’ve likely seen or heard about his shananigans outside the court and in fake Twitter",2
I know we can only guess as to how it’s actually gone done and what jurors will think but I don’t see how much of a defense was presented in the face of a convicted co conspirator saying he did it and the woman in question confirming it,1

"It’s *definitely* something we should discuss as a society, so I’m not saying he deserves a pass, but his greater contribution to American history is valuable enough to preserve and memorialize in spite of everything else.

So, I’m really just saying there may be arguments for keeping up statues of some bad actors from history, but I don’t believe the leaders of the Confederacy generally meet the threshold for deserving recognition in spite of the glaring flaws in their actions and beliefs.",1
Yeah just like when Thomas Jefferson applied today’s standards to his own life,1
">Throughout his entire life, Thomas Jefferson was publicly a consistent opponent of slavery",1
"Calling it a “moral depravity”1 and a “hideous blot,”2 he believed that slavery presented the greatest threat to the survival of the new American nation.3 Jefferson also thought that slavery was contrary to the laws of nature, which decreed that everyone had a right to personal liberty.4

"A stay of execution at the federal level while executions at the state level continue, disillusionment and political disengagement increases in the democratic voting base and then we are right here again in 4 years but in an even worse position then we are now",2

A vote that requires you to effectively condone the callous and disgusting nature of what the Biden admin has been doing since October 7th,2

"Thing is, when you don't want to listen to people about Genocide, they will stop listening to anything you might have to say.  


You can't care about what is going on right now and not go insane from our inaction.  The only remedy is disconnecting the news and activism.


We are literally fostering an environment that discourages political and civic activism.  That it's so normal to so many users on this sub is depressing",2
"> Hate to break it to you but Israel doesn't care about the hostages.

Bibi and his gang of jackasses obviously don’t care … but Israel absolutely cares",2
I’m sure you know the difference.,1
"Don’t worry, they will blame Biden even out of office",0

"As far as I am concerned, Biden is doing his best to provide humanitarian aid to the Palestinians",1
Anyone who wants to criticize that project because it isn’t going 100% smoothly can suck it,1
He has done more than anyone else around the world to make sure food and supplies go to the Palestinians.,1
Why is there only one photo of Judge Aileen Cannon?,0
He says vaccines cause autism and supports the whack job RFK jr.,0
Thats not surprising considering we stopped expanding the house,2
It was originally intended to add a seat per a set number of citizens in a state.,0
"Because its bs, conservatives love Trump and if they don't, they hate the left more.",2
The GOP minority can only win through fear and intimidation.,1
You need to learn your history if you don’t understand that lots of people knew slavery was wrong then too,2
"If that was true, then sign me up",1
I'd love to be a wizard.,1
"The quality of the evidence is dependent on who is providing it and whether they believe what they are saying or not, just like the evidence the prosecution has provided",0
That's within the oath they took,0
The defense can't suggest that the evidence Cohen gave is wrong yet theirs is right and expect the jury to have to take their assertions at face value.,2
We won’t forget,0
"You mean like saying Rafah was a red line so people wouldn't be up in arms a few months ago, and now that we are here, there is no red line.",2
"> This is like if you shot someone and since you were in jail you missed a day of work so your employer suspended you even though you aren't proven guilty of a crime yet.

It's nothing like that, she *was* found guilty of a crime because she pled guilty to the crime.

If you pled guilty to shooting someone (murder/aggravated assault) then your employer certainly has a very good cause to fire you, just like the bar has very good cause to disbar her when she pled guilty to a felony.

I don't think she necessarily needs to disbarred for life, but 3 years is basically a vacation she'll spend fucking around in GOP circles until she gets her law license back in time to mess with the 2028 election.",1
People need to stop judging historical figures by today's standards.,0
"I agree, but it's worth noting that this will be the 5th time (out of 8) since Ohio passed this new deadline in 2010 that a major party convention was scheduled after the new deadline",1
"In 2012 and 2020 both parties scheduled their conventions after the deadline, and the Ohio legislature made exceptions for both parties each time",0
"Republican 2012 convention (Aug 27-Aug30)  
Democratic 2012 convention (Sep 4 - Sep 6)  
Republican 2020 convention (Aug 24-Aug27)  
Democratic 2020 convention (Aug 17-Aug 20)

The big question is if the Ohio GOP will be able to find some reasoning to not accept the DNC nominating virtually",1
Ohio's Senate President has already made it clear that [“Republicans in both the House and the Senate aren’t going to vote for a stand-alone Biden bill.”](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/ohio-lawmakers-are-odds-effort-ensure-biden-appears-november-ballot-rcna151369),1
"I wasn’t implying that, and I’m no strategist, but there are several acres of middle ground between no response and the 35,000+ dead Palestinians, over 55% being women and children by UN estimates.",2
"The longer they wait for a trial to be completed, the higher the chance of him getting elected again, and trying out the “presidential immunity” thing again",1
"No matter what, if justice isn’t served quickly, everything gets a lot messier.",1
The pomp around electors meeting to cast their votes is also ceremonial.,0
I hope they didn’t pull her fart snorkeling license,0
The lady needs to make living.,0
Solve problems is not what he actually did,0
Help his friends in high places is closer to reality.,1
He’s a RFK supporter.,0
Maybe it'll be better if we take that energy and collectively focus it on young people and protesters and hope we can deflate any civic activism they ever had.  Then they will be quiet and we can just carry on not worrying about it /s,1
Fox News is for fascists by fascists.,0
I don’t think they’re aiming to influence the jury,0
"Just like he’s not when he bad mouths judges, prosecutors, and witnesses in foront of crowds, cheering or boo-ing as the case mey be.

As you say, there’s plenty of evidence for the jury to reach their verdict.",2
"> Let's be real.

*begins to speculate*",1
He’s a RFK supporter.,0
"Again, read [the article I linked above.](https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/alabamaivf-sex-aoc-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-rcna141033) They're religious so obviously making women subservient is a big part of what they want, but it goes beyond that",1
"They are actually quite open about what they want:

> ""It seems to me that a good place to start would be a feminist movement against the pill, & for..",1
"returning the consequentiality to sex.""

> Conservatives have to lead the way in restoring sex to its true purpose, & ending recreational sex & senseless use of birth control pills.

> Right-wing activist Christopher Rufo added his two cents, writing on X last week: “‘Recreational sex’ is a large part of the reason we have so many single-mother households” and that “the point of sex is to create children.”

> Last year, Hadley Manning of the right-wing Independent Women’s Forum bemoaned how contraception has created a “culture of cheap sex that has created mass confusion, pain and regret.”

> Controversial conservative faith leader Joshua Butler wrote last year that birth control “intentionally denies a fruitfulness that points forward to the future hope of the kingdom” and that sex while using contraceptives makes participants “unable to bear witness to the work of the Spirit in creation and redemption.”

They're religious so by definition they're all horrible hypocrites who will no doubt engage in all the sex they want, but they are not at all shy about wanting to push this nonsense on everyone else",1
Honestly I think it's naive to think they only want to control women,1
"They want to control *everyone*, men included.",0
"> I never knew it was against the law for a politician to pay for someone's silence, even if the story is damaging to the politician during an election cycle.

That’s actually not one of the charges",0
The crime is illegally hiding a campaign expense as a business expense and/or an attorney retainer,2
"*It works like this:*

The dollars in your wallet automatically become ""rent"" when you hand them to your landlord for your next month’s stay on their property … just like Trump’s dollars automatically become campaign finance when he used them to help his election chances",0
"(People misunderstand and think Trump is accused of taking money from a ""campaign account."" He’s not.)  

His lawyers tried to explain Trump was hiding the expense from his family (not voters) like candidate John Edwards in ‘07, but unlike Edwards who paid the year before an election to hide a recent affair, Trump’s payment was to hide a 10yr old hookup that he only decided to hide less than 2 weeks before his election",2
"And then multiple witnesses in Trump’s own circle confirmed Trump was trying to hide the story from voters, and did not care what his family discovered after the election was over.",1
I love his burn but Bob also thinks vaccines cause Autism.,1
It's also why I cannot understand this jury system,0
The lawyers can say anything they want and just have to adda whitdrawn at the end,0
The jury won't magically unhear it.,0
There is nothing funnier than “who cares about celebrities😭” coming from the party literally screaming and crying about Taylor Swift making and imaginary statement in their minds,2
Also the same dummies who are supporting an actual D-list clown,1
"Same ones who prayed to Kid Rock when he came out in support of Trump, same ones who are throwing hissy fits about Deniro now.",0
Hopefully the majority of voters know dictator wannabe Trump is a narcissist and a prolific liar.,0
Same,0
I have never seen anything like this before either,0
That’s why I say fascism has already taken root in the USA,0
"It isn’t a future risk, it is here",0
"The ironic thing about all this is the GOP fanatically supports the 2A movement, and vice versa",1
"The fascist wing of the GOP is working hard to suppress   peaceful forms of dissent, and the 2A wing of the GOP is working hard to enable violent forms of dissent",2
This isn’t going to end well for either,0
"If Trump takes office and suppresses dissent, as he promises to do, some frustrated jackass will take a pot shot at one of Trump’s officials",2
When that happens Trump will expand the martial law he imposed on day one and personal gun ownership in the USA will come to a sudden end,0
"This is as predictable as sunrise and sunset, but all I hear from the 2A world is how Biden wants to take their guns away.",2
It's also perfomative on the part of Biden,0
"As we can see in Rafah, Israel has no problem using smaller or different US munitions to inflict casulties on Palestinians.",0
"On the one hand, none of us deserves to be remembered only for the worst thing we’ve ever done, and the same goes for historical figures, too.

On the other hand, we’re talking about being actively involved in insurrection against your country on the grounds of wanting to keep slaves for, at best, economic reasons, but more likely just plain old horrible racism",2
People who are happy to kill their countrymen to continue brutally oppressing brown people to make their plantations more profitable would have to do an awful lot of good to be worthy of being remembered favorably by the country they tore in half,1
"Frankly, none of the Confederate leaders really strike me as having made up for their actions",1
Our simply forgetting them is probably the kindest thing they deserve.,0
"They don't, they say it will only be a little worse",2
Obviously not paying any attention to what him and other republicans have said,2
Their entire argument comes down to the fact that they can't control their lives so will punish the dems for not giving them the choice they want,2
"Because they will not be made to do another thing they don't agree with and vote for a lesser evil.

They are just throwing a fit like a toddler.",2
That's just slavery with extra steps.,0
"While true, the GOP is more than happy to let this narrative that it was dems spearheading the CO movement",1
"I have yet to see a single republican, MAGA or otherwise, know, or acknowledge, that it was republicans who pushed for his removal in the state.

Obviously the dems didn't interfere, but they weren't behind it.",2
It's like the philosopher who thinks it is always immoral to lie being asked by a Nazi if they're hiding and housing Jewish refugees to protect them from persecution,0
"(according to lore) He did still have his injuries from the crusifiction after re-animating, so being blown to bits would logically incapicitate him no matter what.",1
Trump doesn’t have to be the mastermind of a plan,0
His M.O,0
"is to hire someone more competent to think up a scheme, send them off to do the dirty work, and try to claim plausible deniability while also live-streaming the scheme on Twitter.

I don’t think we should ever settle on “Trump’s not even smart enough to do the crime”",1
"He has enough money to find people to be smart for him (well, smarter).",1
Don't care,0
He's not going to be President.,0
You need to read about the Weimar republic and the role of liberals and conservatives in facilitating Hitlers rise to power,0
Or maybe about apartheid South Africa,0
Or maybe about any multitude of topics that liberals (not progressives/leftists/socialists) were on the wrong side of history on but pretended not to be after the fact.,2

"Luckily I was good at slab and sculpting, so I squeaked by.",1
Why wouldn’t they? Republicans are always trying to get celebrities but most don’t like them,1
They use a famous song and get hit with a cease and desist,1
They try to get someone famous to speak and end up with kid rock at best,1
"So why not stick it to them by getting someone not only very famous, but very famous among republicans?

Oh they will all act like they hate DeNiro but they love his movies and acting",1
Has to piss them off that every celebrity they love thinks they’re crazy.,2
"You keep on telling yourself that buddy.

I have seen /r/Politics do this across many different elections now lol",1
"It is one of the biggest echo chambers on Reddit, and there is always a solid month after an election of people genuinely confused at the result because this sub told them Dems are a sure thing.",1
"I can see it not being unusual, I'm saying it isn't standard procedure, and when it's a request for the judge to take a specific action, there is no need to confer",1
"Conferring would be if there is some sort of reason to hash out details, or request something from the other side",2
Neither of which is necessary in a motion for a gag order.,0
"If we don't make these deals other countries like Russia, China and Iran will instead",2
Then it would be those counties that influenced them,0
Until all countries are run by people that want to get along and not start wars it is necessary to try and make sure that counties that have claimed or acted as enemies are not the ones influencing them,1
"With us influencing them the hope is to push them towards agreements on things like nukes and rules in war.

The problem is war has been made to be profitable",1
And way too many people in power see it as the best way to get what they want,1
They fight to keep the wars going so they can keep selling their weapons,0
"Until we get these people out of government the people like Biden that have tried to what he can to convince Israel to be more careful about civilians, and the ones that would try and do more to stop it, will be hindered.",1
In your opinion how long should Israel go without responding to attacks from hamas so the cycle ends?,2
This is disgusting,2
Corrupt scumbag of a judge.,2
"It did actually pass as evidence! The case was dropped, but the picture was admitted as evidence",0
Holy shit do I know more about this than you? Isn’t this your whole thing?,1
No one cares about this,0
The top two negatives against Biden are the economy and abortion,1
"Part of the abortion issue is most likely conservatives who voted for Biden in 2020 because Trump was so horrible but don't like his pro choice stance, but part of it is people who blame Biden for the overturning of Roe since it happened during his presidency and they don't understand how government works.",2
"No, the judge and the attorneys determine what counts as evidence and enter it as such",0
The behavior of the attorneys is not evidence of anything in any legal sense.,1
I think the process of seeing how much of a liar Trump is was the good thing .,1
the verdict is secondary.,0
"in my humble opinion

Is he trying to get sympathy so the jury feels sorry for Trump and aiming for jury nullification?,2

I don't live in the district but I can't see why anyone would vote for Herrera,2
"His platform is basically to do whatever Trump tells him and guns, so he'd be another Lauren Boebert type.

Obviously it was catnip for the always-online far right types (he was campaigning with Matt Gaetz a few days ago), but I can't imagine the people of that district care about nothing more than the Second Amendment and stroking Trump's ego.",1

Sure but much of the Hamas leadership group is outside of Gaza,1
"Specifically in Jordan, Qatar and Lebanon, among others",0
There are leaders on the group but the people in charge of the brainwashing aren't in Gaza,0
"So what is the end goal with the barrage on Gaza? Further, those giving teenagers guns aren't major leaders but minor group leaders throughout the region",2
"Killing all of them is akin to eliminating Hamas.

Right but if those tunnels run all throughout residential buildings then those become terrorist targets,1
If Hamas doesn't care about Palestinians than every building could hold weapons are thus becomes terrorist infrastructure,0
"Again, that means leveling Gaza",0
I don't support completely destroying the entire country,0
"Do you?

A ground invasion in close quarters combat would result in even higher civilian casualties",1
"You say you don't want all Palestinians dead but I ask you, what percentage of civilians killed is acceptable for trying to eliminate Hamas in Gaza? At what point would it be unacceptable? And is it unacceptable to kill civilians and aid workers who have no possible military significance?",2
