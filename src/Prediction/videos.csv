"This judge does not appear to be a complete idiot, so it'd be hard to convince the judge that you're not just making shit up given what the judge witnessed.

> Public defender knew her client was screwed.

Yep",2
And remember she has to work with that judge and the other people in that courtroom all the time,2
By trying to convince the judge of something that is probably just bullshit she does nothing for her client while harming her credibility,0
**A public defender has a responsibility to defend their clients,0
They cannot submit evidence they know to be false.** In fact they can lose their license for that shit,2
"Probably not in this case, but these people imagining a public defender with more than 2 brain cells is going to tell the judge a lie (that the judge will see through) are living in fantasy land.

She could get in a lot of trouble by telling this guy to go to the ER and say he had chest pain or something just to get the documentation,2

If you’re caught driving with a suspended license you should be imprisoned for at least 3 years,2
Full stop.,1
I don’t agree…Nearly Everyone of them is either about safety or negligence,1
You could maybe make an argument on insurance or court fines but I honestly think there’s a better argument to be made that it’s against a proper punishment,1
"Driving without a license- without a liscence you haven’t proven you can safely operate a vehicle

DUI- you’ve shown reckless disregard for safety in operating a vehicle drunk 

Insurance- agree not about safety",2
"More about negligently operating a vehicle in a way where you may not be able to pay for damages you cause 

Failure to appear in court- not about safety… I’ll grant you 

Failure to pay fines- failure to abide by punishments received after failing to operate a vehicle correctly in some way (and thus receiving a fine)

Reckless driving- unsafe handling of a vehicle

DMV demerit points- achieved through unsafe handling of a vehicle 

Drug- I assume another form of dui.",1
"obtained by operating a vehicle unsafley (ie high)

Child- no idea what this is

Leaving the scene of an accident- negligence 

Drunk driving- unsafe 

Fatal accident- pinnacle of unsafe 

Habitually committing traffic offenses- repeated negligence or safety violations

Vehicular felonies- gotta be doing something unsafe or dumb 

Multiple speeding violations- repeated operating of a vehicle in a manner deemed unsafe 

Underage possession of alcohol- failure to follow rules for alcohol which puts you at high risk for inability to follow traffic rules",2
"This one could be argued 

Unpaid traffic tickets- as above 

School- no idea what this means 

Refusal to take a breathalyzer test- probably not operating a vehicle in a safe manner

Fleeing an accident- as above 

Habitual traffic offender classification- as above",1
If it’s a reasonable situation to not have it or an honest mistake I think most cops will let you slide as long as you know your license number,1
"They probably figure you aren’t going to start adding felonies to a misdemeanor by giving a false name and license number lol, so if you don’t seem like a possible felon on the run they aren’t going to make a big deal of it.

I think mobile finger print machines also make these situations pretty rare nowadays at least when I live in California.",1
Well I guess you get to cool down in jail then lol,1
"I for one don't know, but the founding fathers would want us to be able to drink while we have bear arms",1
some people really have no idea how cold and black and white the letter of the law is,2
"if you're caught and proven guilty on the other side of it, that's it, full stop.

in this case, i'm willing to bet that he thought this would be allowed bc he was going to the doctor (if he even was) and that having a good excuse, and pulling over as soon as he saw the judge would make it ok",1
"whether it's ignorance or excuse, i have no idea, but in some part of his brain, he thought this was acceptable somehow.

too many people have gotten away with bullshit and shitty behavior by being an even bigger piece of shit that other people let slide but the law will make sure you pay your price, no matter how shitty you are.

you see this with people who fight cops and karens who argue with the judge",1
they face their first real hard line consequence they can't talk or argue their way out of they don't know what else to do.,2
"Possibly, but it was more than a handful",1
My anecdote may be from early on too,1
I didn't keep watching what people said after the first couple months because I had heard enough to turn me off of it.,1
"Why do so many court rooms look so, shitty?  Like they have duct tape on the floor, the worst looking carpets.

I'm not saying they should be palaces of opulance, but jesus there's some happy medium.",1
"Huge percentages? Do you have actual data to support this or are you just talking out of your ass?

"Garland is also British and I've never once met a foreigner who fully understands what's happening in America, when so few Americans seem to.",2
Seeing all this old software or similar software I used to use when I was younger has made me feel old,1
"I used to use Cheat Engine, T-Search, Ollydbg, WPE Pro and even Roboform when I was younger",0
If it were me back in the day I wouldnt even have tried to set breakpoints at the address cause I was lazy,2
"I would have just done the cheat engine .dll injection for the unrandomizer and start it at 1362124800 and just had it go up in increments of 1, then write a quick ACtool macro to copy the generated passwords and paste them in a notepad to input into a brute forcer",1
"And that would have taken a long time probably if it even worked without crashing roboform.

None of that would have worked I'm sure, so I would have just gone back to playing video games.",1
Definitely an entertaining watch lol,1
They must have must have know it was something special when [**THIS Happened**](https://youtu.be/t5HdwiESYJs?t=3),1
Happened to my cousin,0

He drove very carefully from then on.,2
"I love the '70s leisure wear uniforms, and the super groovy lounge with what I assume is an orgy pit?",1
">Clam down

let's assume child and fines have nothing to do with safety,0
Is that not enough to consider that maybe some of the suspensions are bullshit?,0
"The overwhelming majority are dressed well, sitting at a desk or table, professional",1
"That's why the crazy ones are so memorable - are you gonna remember the person wearing office attire answering your interview questions well, or are you going to remember the person getting on their knees and sobbing in front of a poster of your org's president and CEO about how if they ever met your organization's president they don't even know what they would do with themselves?  And then touching the poster and smiling and saying how grateful they are to be in the same building as that person?

At a prior job I also had to give a basic computer literacy test to people (like, ""what are the shortcuts for copying and pasting?  How do you open an internet browser?  What does Ctrl + Alt + Delete do?"" which included a typing test - once had someone take an hour to do the aptitude test (this is after the interview), and then when I checked on him to make sure he was still alive he was like ""okay great, just finished warming up on my typing test, I'm ready to do it for real now"" and he spent the *entire time just taking typing tests and not scoring higher than 25 wpm*",1

i dont want to debate with you about which ones are safe and which aren't,1
Let's just leave it to the fact that a significant amount of suspensions are for bullshit reasons that have nothing to do with safety.,1
"We aren't talking about programming here fam, you are approaching this from the wrong area of expertise",2
Neural networks are computer science problem,0
"That's software, we are talking about hardware",0
"The human brain isn't a program, it's a chip",0
"It has no software and nothing that could be really analogue to software, saying ""self-awareness is software"" is just philosophical rhetoric",1
The workings of the brain are about the mechanical complexity of the electric chips that are our nerves,0
"This is fundamentally an electric engineering problem.

We are all built on the same electroconductive molecule computing system, where electrons commute in a given path that's determined by the electric tension differential between point A and B and provokes chemical reactions as it crosses these pathways",1
**This is** ***exactly*** **how it works in the living and in the inanimate**: Electricity is made to move in the least resistant pathway in our nerves and in our gold+copper+etc computer chips,2
"Except we really hate having chemical reactions in our chips because they tend to turn them into bricks as the pathways break down.

What changes is the complexity of the path as lain in the ""grid"", for lack of a better word, which is limited by the size and therefore complexity in which these pathways are built",2
And that's determined by the material technology,0
"Nerve tissue is an array of electrically reactive biomolecules that's designed on a scale that's almost down to the individual molecule, where basically everything that happens is accounted for or accounted to get rid of, while today we work CMOS ""merely"" on the nanometer scale, and you can still trace the single electric path a processor takes at a point in time",2
"If you want examples of this difference of size and therefore complexity, refer back to the ""chips hate chemistry"" sentence above - while our plastic toys need a sealed internal environment to operate without breaking, organic tissue not only has managed to control any potential chemical reactions to the point they are harmless, it also has chemical mechanisms to repair many forms of damage, systems built entirely on the way molecules are arranged in organic cells",2
Few things short of the complete physical destruction of the tissue can damage a working nerve's electric grid,2
">!The lack of sealage also means we literally short circuit if find we touch something conductive!<

Not to mention that we the living aren't a single computer, we have many autonomous bioelectric functions - reflexes - that are independent of our concious+subconcious brain",1
"See the famous knee-cap reaction.

To give you context, if humans and computers were reduced to physical contraptions composed only of cogs and pulleys, a computer chip could be assigned around a thousand moving parts while a human neuronal system would have something like a million and it may even reach the billion, and a solid 2 digit % of them are entirely independent from the rest of the machine",1
"Try to build one of those eh?

Which takes us back to the ""computers will never be humans!"" philosophical cope",0
"Matter of fact we have already overengineered computers to beat organic tissue at single tasks, a simple matter of just putting bigger processors than our brains actually use to perceive external stimuli",2
"That makes any software they are given run faster than they would on human ""hardware""",0
"Computers see, hear and think better than us",1
"But they just can't be as electrochemically interdependent at us, as we only use chemistry to start the electric flow, not to manipulate it",0
"In order to it in a ""purely"" electric matrix we'd need build pathways a thousand times smaller than today, spread them out to take in all the additional chemical mechanisms we'd be replacing",0
"**Actually imitating the tasks organic tissue evolved to carry in a CMOS-based chip the size of a modern PC would be nothing short of an electric engineering miracle.** If we were built a large enough *set* of computers we could replicate every system perfectly with today's electric technology, we could, and basically we could create a better human mind",1
Provided we figure out how it works first,1
"If I were you, i'd get a nice, comfy chair while waiting for that, because the scale of mechanical complexity organic tissue operates on makes you finest chips look like simple copper wire.

Now, neither this post, yours, nor the one u/NumbersNumbers111 made are actually related to mimicking the *behavioral results* of these functions with software as done in OP's skit",1
"On that subject we are getting extremely capable at and i'd say it's a given that soon you'll never be able to trick these ""autocomplete algorithms"" again",1
">!And some of his essays are flat out wrong, we are in fact born with innate knowledge of some things, eat your heart out Locke!<

***tl;dr*** the short of is that organic electricity is designed to be chemically heterogenous (multiple types of molecules) while inorganic electricity is mostly homogenous, built off a few select materials",2
"Beyond that it's all electric signals.

Also, you can shove your ""demonstrates your misunderstanding of the blah"" accusations right up your ass, you r/science wannabe.",1

"I got a minor citation once in backwoods Texas town and had to go to the county courthouse and 60% of the other cases were either some other minor charge, possession, something alcohol related, with a loss of drivers license, and the remaining were specific citations for driving with a suspended license.

It seemed like a lucrative game.",2
this is the same judge i just saw with the dude who was caught rolling a blunt in his car before coart XD this guy really sees some goofy shit,1
That's actually the thought I had,0
"But if that's the case, then he shouldn't be allowed a license anyway.

You don't get a free pass for being dumb.",2
Gotta be prepared for the client to say/do something ridiculous.,2

Backing yourself into a corner to the point you no longer have any left is *your fault*.,0
"in my state, it's a correctable offense to not have your license on your person-- you need to go to court and show them your license",0

You need to have your driver's license on you while driving.,0
I would make the analogy it's more like suspending someone from chewing..,1

"Pretty much all of them include life and death, which clearly isn’t happening in this case, and the defender isn’t going to instruct her client to lie right in front of the judge",1
"Yes she’s supposed to be a zealous advocate, but I’d argue she advocates just fine here",1
You’re holding her to a ridiculous standard.,2
hes definitely a hardened criminal for driving to a doctors appointment because his license was suspended..,2
jail time is definitely deserved.,2
I have the same memory lol,1

If you can get a dui riding a bicycle where the fuck is the line then? Its either all together or none at all,2
When ever someone's license is suspended it should automatically just be made to restricted and not fully suspended,0
I've seen some dumb reason for people's licenses to be suspended and needing to go to work and even a doctor's appointment gets severely difficult at that point.,2
That’s not “driving without a license” just because it’s not on you..,0
"Well, he’s supposed to be going to jail at ‘6pm today’ isn’t he?",2

It's shameful.,0
"Mate, she doesn’t have a case",0
Actually trying the adjournment route was a pretty decent move that had a better chance at working than pretty much all the other stuff you’ve suggested.,1
I had to go to court once for driving on a suspended license,0
In my defense,0
I was from another country and didn't know it was suspended,0
"I, too, was a moron about it as I didn't pay a speeding fine (because I lived in another country and ignored it for 10+ years)",2
Then got pulled over for an obstructed license plate,0
"When the cop came back he was like ""You know I could arrest you right now for driving while suspended, but (glances in car of friends on a road trip) I don't think you want me to do that",1
"So here's your court-date""",0
Luckily the lawyer had good advice and the judge reduced it to a misdemeanor (from a felony) and a $500 fine,1
It also didn't end up affecting my Nexus rapid-entry or later my US Citizenship,0
:).,0
Michigan courts are something else,0
There was a district court feed about a year ago that had a defendant smoking crack next to his girlfriend..,0
which had a restraining order against him..,0
"which the case was about.

Edit: Forgot to mention he also openly shoplifted in his next appearance.",0
"My license was suspended more times than I can count, due to some kind of mixup between Maryland and Virginia, and my child support.

Just about every month I'd get a warning that my license would be suspended for failure to pay my child support",1
"Virginia was taking the child support out of my check, but somehow Maryland was always getting it late and reporting it as unpaid.

There is a lot to this story, but at the end of the day..",2
I wasn't going to not drive because Maryland couldn't get their shit straight,1
"I only got pulled over like 3 times in the entire 20 years that this was happening, so it wasn't a huge deal",1
I had a letter from the DCSE in Virginia explaining that I *was* in fact paying,0
"The few times I got pulled over, I was told they couldn't let me drive home but they never arrested or ticketed me.

All of that is to say, perhaps this dude was dealing with some bullshit like this",2
"Unlikely for sure, but possible.

What he did in this video though, is laughably stupid.",2

Must suck when you have to defend criminals all day by giving them excuses and justifying their behaviour,0

I looked into and they don’t.,0
Um,0
I could be wrong but I thought the shot that revealed the entire mass grave was people of color and his xenophobia toward the two journalists he killed implied that he had been to the nearby “oddly peaceful” federal aligned (traditional American flag shown on town entry) town run by creepy dudes on rooftops which is where he collected all those bodies (I don’t think any POC were portrayed *living* in the peaceful town),2
"Since the town was under federal control and also the fact that they are wearing fatigues (secessionist soldiers in this region are seen without “real” gear sort of implying they’re a militia rather than the well supplied federal military and WF) as well as the fact that Plemons is immediately hostile to the press, and is only looking for the smallest reason to murder them, and it has previously been revealed that the federal govt is extremely hostile to the press (which is why they only ever embed w Florida alliance and WF)",2
"Furthermore they hint that maybe one of the defining features of the federal government, which seems to be very unpopular amongst most other Americans, is that they might be super racist",1
The old black reporter says “do I really have to spell it out?” when referring to why he “needs” to be on the front lines for the July 4 push to DC,2
My thought was maybe his reason was it was especially meaningful as a black man,1
He also suggests that the all white happy town would be an unsafe place for them to stay and rest (“it wouldn’t have suited us anyway we would’ve gotten bored”) once he is spotted by the roof people,1
In contrast I think the snipers were probably WF but this is flimsier,0
I only guess that because they are covered in colored dust which appears to be a tactic of the secessionists as seen in the firefight between the irregulars (maybe Floridians?) and the presence of the colored dust at the stadium,2
He asks if they’re WF because they’re in uniforms which means they’re either wf or federal,0
He assumes wf because they don’t seem hostile,0
They could be either because the territory is in flux here near the front lines,1
To the point where WF forces “have been stalled” due to “losing their supply lines”,2
It would appear the gang is arriving in Charlottesville right as these lines are being restablished - hence the assault by WF,1
I also think that the reason the guy in the house shot at the car despite the press label is because he’s a federalist or loyalist who hates the press as they seem to do,0
I think the main point of this scene though is that they couldn’t been either and it didn’t matter.,1
"True, if he didn't care enough to not drive without a license, he probably forgot about the court date.",1
"If you have to have a car to live your life, you should probably not fuck around and get your license yoinked",1
Let's also not pretend like you don't have to have *multiple* infractions or unpaid tickets to get your license suspended,0
"Also suspension isn't really a deterant, those are what tickets are for",2
Suspension is what happens when the deterant hasn't worked.,0
WTf,2
"No one is saying this man is a victim, frankly he's beyond an idiot to the point he's actively dangerous.

And that's why it's so important to use this as an opportunity to talk about America's car centrism and shitty infrastructure as it's simply the pragmatic answer.

Let's zoom out for a minute and talk about sheer pragmatic realities, in the US not having car is almost guarenteed for non-employment which will inevitably lead to homelessness and/or death",2
Now to your surprise I'm not going to argue whether that's inherently a good or a bad thing,2
Instead what I'm going to argue is that from a pragmatic sense it's causing a selection bias for commiting these acts,0
"Because the decision in a lot of these places isn't ""Risk going to jail"" vs ""Just take the bus"", the decision is ""Risk going to jail"" vs ""Being homeless""",2
"Naturally being a non guarenteed result these people that have already shown to embody anti-social, selfish, and frankly stupid behavior are going to pick the option that just risks their lives being ruined over the one that guarentees it.

Worse though is that for every one of this douchebag there's going to nine more that never get caught until make an innocent person a victim of their selfish acts",2
"Shifting the victimhood to these innocent people who will feel the pain and impact of something they don't deserve, and no matter how we ramp up enforcement it's just unviable to reliably catch the other nine before they commit their crime.

I'd also argue that said public transportation spending also benefits the blameless victims directly also as obviously better transportation could be a better solution for their personal life.

But tl;dr don't think of this as an act to reward the perps, think of it as an act to protect the truly innocents",1
Because just base decision making means until you do give viable public transportation and cultural shifts they are going to take the option that spills more blood everytime.,2

"This isn't a ""big fuckup, of the sort you'll probably make two or three times in your life,"" it's a ""you'd have to be mentally incapacitated to do this"" video",0
Lots of people drive to a courthouse on a suspended license when being charged with driving on a suspended license,0
They all say that their friend dropped them off at the courthouse,0
"Sometimes, the judge will then say he/she is going to check the courthouse camera footage to double-check, at which point the defendant usually says ""oh...um...actually, I drove myself.""  
  
When they drove to court, they were likely simply thinking ""the judge is in court, he won't know how I got here."" Maybe some think a step ahead and think ""If asked, I'll just say a friend dropped me off."" They don't know the parking lot has cameras, or they know it but they don't expect the judge would go through all the trouble of pulling up security camera footage",2
"So they have a weak-ass plan, but *they have a plan*",2
*That's* the kind of fuckup that happens because of financial straits,1
It's not super uncommon,2
"But there's a very, very big difference between that and making your appearance in court *live on camera where you can be seen engaging in the crime you're accused of*, and then nonchalantly *telling* the judge that you're engaging in the crime you're accused of",1
That's zero plan,0
"He didn't even do the thing where he turns off his camera, say that his camera isn't working ""for some reason,"" and then pretends to figure it out once he's no longer driving",0
I've seen what I'm pretty sure is that from time to time,1
"Again, I get what you're getting at with cases where people don't recognize that defendants have made a choice because they're stuck between a rock and a hard place (like driving to court because they're too poor to call an uber, have no friends who can drive them, and would lose bail status for a failure to appear if they didn't go to court), but this isn't that kind of situation, it's mentally incapacitated territory.",2

"I guess we can give arbitrary sentences for crimes since the simple solution is for people not to commit crimes.

The comment also already told you what else could be done ie offer good public transport",1
Transportation as stupid as it sounds is a basic need like shelter,2
"Also most people don't drive like maniacs because driving is just a utility to them, they actually want to get somewhere and not die within a couple of weeks, not to mention that you usually aren't any faster by driving erratically most time wasted comes from stuff like traffic not the speed limit or having to follow roads",1

"No ones mentioning he's a victim, this is simple causality, cause and effect",2
"Man can't provide a living without a car, what's he going to do lie over and die or just drive the car? This in turn hurts the general public, if anything the general public is the victim here and these car unfriendly infrastructure acts as a selection bias for harm to be done to law abiding citizens this way.

No one is saying the man shouldn't be in jail for being caught red handed like that",2
It's just a simple matter that for every 1 of him there are 9 others that won't be caught until they harm someone because on a personal level there is no incentive to comply,0
"Yes you might say the incentive is ""Not be in jail"" which is normally a very good incentive but in this case it's being balanced against ""Not being homeless"" or ""Not being dead"" and it becomes obvious what survival instinct chooses as the greater of two bad choices.",1
">You can’t even be armed in any place that serves

Best argument is potential medical necessity.,1

It's certainly possible for people to have suspensions for bullshit reasons",2

Do people really tune into these court session streams just to watch this guy? Or just watch random court sessions in general? I mean I get having random stuff on as background noise or whatever but this is a whole other level lmao.,2
">usually, a consequence of *dangerous actions*

I'm willing to bet the vast majority of suspended licenses are as a result of failure to pay for renewal or being pulled over without valid insurance and having their license revoked as a result.

Neither of which are dangerous, negligent, but not dangerous.",2
Are you kidding? That guy was hilarious,1
Really creative way to compare the AIs,1
If you think he was actually testing them in real time you are an idiot.,2
I'd be willing to bet that he completely forgot about court lol,1

Imagine using the plot of a movie to frame a kid for borderline sexualized behavior between a child and an adult,0
"Your perspective right now is beyond wild.

You realize the movie is *not* real right? But the action still happened? An adult kissed a child on the lips.

This is why people like Dan Schneider get away with this shit",1
People really just don’t see anything is wrong.,2
"Of the hundreds of people, have you ever hired someone who made a fool of themselves by means of not giving a flying fuck?

Yeah I think he’s just been driving without his license for so long he forgot he wasn’t supposed to be,2
"Oh my god, what is going on in this district?",0
"Sure does, definitely-genuine-user!",1
Fucks sake.,0
"Because AIs already pass the turing test if it's written.

The reason why AIs sounds so weird in conversation even when The voice chat is extremely realistic..",2
Is the same reason all AIs are easy to tell right now,1
They are either too precise or horrifically wrong,2
"And respond the way we write.

I was listening to an AI narrator on YouTube earlier today",0
If you misspelled a word it didn't correct it or pronounce it in a way that would make sense,0
So for Japane (clearly a misspelling of Japan) it pronounced JapanEee..,1
Instead of JapAIN which would have been the only charitable English mispronounceation if you didn't immediately recognize it was a typo,0
By having humans read the response they can transform it into a little bit more conversational speech simply by introducing error.,1
You'd be paying them,0
"Are your interviews paid? I get you have to filter out your candidates somehow, but when you're begging for workers you might want to start reducing the number of arbitrary hoops you make people jump through",0
I mean..,2
unless you just get off on the power dynamic.,0
Training and use are two distinct steps with ANNs which is very different from how brains update with use live,1
"A lot of ANNs are also just started from scratch with each update and only get trained once then never again.

There are structural similarities, of course there are neural nets were inspired by the structure of the brain but there's a lot of functional leaps between where we are with them and brains.",1
I generally agree with the sentiment - punishing people with no solution doesn't help them (or society) resolve the issue,2
But something on the order of 80% of people live within a 10 minute bike of a grocery store,1
"The joke used to be that after the drunks got their DUIs and had their cars impounded, you could find them biking along the road.",0
"It's crazy how many people feel like they're entitled to driving, I agree with the OP that it sucks that there's so few alternatives to having your own car (especially in the countryside) but you really do need to fuck around to lose your license",1
"The consequences of putting other people in danger really should be rough, and honestly it isn't rough enough considering how many fuckers like the dude in the video drive around without licenses/insurance these days.",1
I didn't say anything about change,0
"Of course, people can and do change",0
"The question is, should someone entrusted with a powerful position be allowed to remain there, whether they claim to have changed or not",1
"How are we supposed to know if someone has changed? Just take their word for it?

Does the soldier that gets dishonorably discharged, but has reportedly changed get to rejoin the military? No",2
Do doctors that lose their licenses for malpractice get them back if they've changed? Almost always a no,0
"Do non-violent felons get the right to own guns again if they've changed? No.

Why should it be any different for this judge? Of course people change, but if you are in a prestigious position, I really don't think that should matter",2
"You were given a chance, and a prestigious one at that, to uphold the law of the land, and Judge Simpson failed",2
"He should have been removed from the bench.

Now, I'll wait for your reply where you twist my words again and focus on some miniscule part of my argument that you take issue with.",0
"no, that's nonsense",0
Neural networks are similar to neurons and neuronal connections in the way that a campfire is similar to a diesel engine,0
Assuming that it's just a scale problem demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the technology.,0
"""Okay, um, maybe I'm not understanding something.""

Just sent me.",1
"Feel like that's more ""strategy"" than ""staged"".",1
It sounds dangerously close to saying people shouldn't have to take responsibility for their actions.,2
I've taken the bus and lightrail in my home city a few times but never had to rely on it on a long term basis so I don't have a lot of experience planning work around it,2
But I'm extremely sympathetic to the wish for more walkable cities,1
Every time I've had the joy of experiencing a truly walkable space it leaves me wishing everywhere was like that rather than the subtle hostility of sidewalks inches from instant death,1
"[This illustration](https://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/11/18/7236471/cars-pedestrians-sidewalks-roads) sums it up well.

Anyway, what you're saying makes sense",0
"That said, impounding the car could ruin any other drivers that use it, which is common especially in poor areas, so it doesn't seem like a workable option in the general case",2
Not sure what real solution there is there to solve the apparent circular issue of people needing to drive to avoid biking on unsafe roads being driven by people that need to drive - other than an infrastructure overhaul to make roads more bike-friendly of course,1
"Still, it would be better if he ate the 1-2 hour commute penalty for having his license revoked, and I think it's for the best if we crack down on unlicensed driving when people choose not to do so.",1

"“Suspending someone's license really only works to deter them if they have other options, otherwise it's like suspending someone from eating - they're going to have to do it.”  

They always have another option - jail.

Getting your license suspended isn’t an accident, you have to be a moron to let it get to that point.",2

people are complaining about this..,0
"I mean if base jumping is a legal recreational activity, why shouldn't incidents like this be covered by search and rescue just like any other recreational activity in the mountains?",2
"I've interviewed a *lot* of people the past few years (a few hundred, I counted lol)",1
"I think you would be surprised at the amount of people who are driving during the interview, have someone else in the car with them while driving while being interviewed, who are pumping gas or grocery shopping, or are laying in bed in their pajamas (and absolutely not hiding it, I'm talking crumpled blanket, full jammies, slept in 'til noon and showing it)",1
"Some people do not give a single flying fuck, and these are the people who usually think they're a shoo-in for the job.",2
Then don't get your license suspended,0
"Consequences exists for a reason, and if they weren't intrusive and a major pain in the ass then what would keep people from driving like maniacs, or drunk driving, or road raging etc etc?

And sure, taking away someone's ability to get to work, drive their children to school, and go to appointments (like this guy was obviously doing right lol?) usually forces them to drive illegally, but doing that in front of a judge and prosecutors is a major tip-off that this person probably shouldn't be behind the wheel with that kind of decision making power.",1
At least he didn't say anything and make it worse,2

I'm gonna make some phone calls and have you indicted for double jeopardy! You ever heard of double jeopardy? You will find out what double jeopardy is! Double jeopardy!,0
No,0
"Do not drive with a suspended license, period",0
Driving is not a right.,1
">You might be surprised to find out that if you get your license suspended

Licenses don't just get suspended out of nowhere",1
"It's not like getting rained on.

Suspension of license is a punishment",0
That punishment has more serious consequences for people in some circumstances than others,2
"That punishment is, usually, a consequence of *dangerous actions*",2
"Typically, a suspended license means you are no longer trusted to safely operate a car - a high-velocity, high-mass piece of equipment.

We certainly should have better public transportation, walkable cities, etc",1
That is a true statement,1
"But separately, in the current world, if someone's choices are between being destitute and *endangering other people*, then the right choice for them is to be destitute, and we certainly can blame them for choosing to (continue to) endanger others.",1
I mean.,2
don't break the law in the first place and it's not an issue,1
"If you get caught with a suspended license, chances are you again were breaking the law causing the pull over.",0
"But the ""AI"" we have now isn't able to simulate thinking, that's the problem, we keep calling a statistical model an intelligence, when it isn't, it doesn't know anything",2

“Glad she banged him” 💀🤣,1
While I'm not saying he shouldn't take public transportation I take you never had to take it before,0
It absolutely sucks outside of major cities like NYC,2
"Delays, takes literally forever to get anywhere if you have to take multiple buses, the people you ride with are there because it is literally their only option so you see some interesting people to say the least, our cities really ain't walkable, etc",1
And biking you have people like him on the road with not even two brain cells to rub together,0
"If I still had car while I had a suspended license the convenience factor is all too real.

For a idea of how rough it can be I live in a much larger city  than him and my 15-20 minute commute would turn into a 1 hour 20 minute ordeal assuming everything is running on time.

They should just impound their car if they suspend their license",1
I've never heard of a person with a suspended license who actually stopped driving.,0
Hard disagree,2
I think the OG series has the most consistently good writing of the entire canon,1
"There are some stinkers, yes, but overall it is fantastic.",1
He can get an occupational license to go get groceries and go to the doctor?,0
I think about this every day.,0
i rewatched that and it does look like that guy vapes at one point,0
Didn't say it was an excuse to attend your hearing actively driving with a suspended license,2
"I said it lowered that from ""you'd have to be mentally incapacitated to do this"" to ""a big fuckup, of the sort you'll probably make two or three times in your life"".",0
"What about getting to school, groceries, or medical?

I remember reading a LONG time ago that some states allowed 14 year-olds to drive to school if it was within a particular range.",1
People say this shit all the time! Well..,2
"not people, but ya know..",0
'job creators'.,0
Well he had the option of not doing whatever it was that got his license suspended in the first place.,1

"IsItBullshit: Nicole Kidman's father died while fleeing pedophilia and child sacrifice cult charges.

I have the picture of a news article saved in my gallery and I'm not sure whether this information is real",1
"The rest of the article reads as follows:

""Dr",0
Antony Kidman died Friday after fleeing Australia when accused of the sexual abuse and murder of children in an elite Sydney pedophile ring,1
A month prior Fiona Barnett had filed a complaint with the Australian NSW police and Child Abuse Royal Commission alleging Kidman's sexual and physical assaults on her throughout childhood,2
When the Commission opened an investigation the clinical psychologist suddenly left his 43 years with the Sydney University of Technology and Royal North Shore Hospital to stay in Singapore until he died,0
"The family has refused to comment and Singapore police opened an investigation on what they termed as an unnatural death

Yesterday Barnett released her own theory about Kidman's death,"" The main perpetrator of my child sexual abuse, Antony Kidman, is dead after I filed formal complaints accusing him of the rape, torture and murder of children in an exclusive Sydney pedophile ring",1

Just seeing the liquid Co2 turn back to ice was worth the click,1
Being poor and desperate is an excuse to drive with a suspended license,2
It is NOT an excuse to attend your court hearing while actively driving with a suspended license.,2
I used to vape back when it was taking off at first,1
Like from 2011-2015 give or take a few years,2
Back then propylene glycol (PG) was the main liquid used,1
This was also what my grandmother used to vape her emphysema medicine,0
"But it was thin and leaky, so vegetable glycerin (VG) was introduced to thicken the PG.

Eventually, whether people preferred the clouds or thickness or the allure of “vegetable” in the name, VG became the most popular liquid",1
"People started doing 50/50, then 80/20, and eventually even 90/10 VG to PG ratios",0
I’m sure people were even doing 100% VG,1
There came a point where you couldn’t get mostly PG liquid anymore,1
This is when I quit,0
"To me, VG was thick, and I could feel it sitting in my lungs",2
"Before VG, my coughs were normal",1
"After VG, they were wet and deep and concerning.

I tried a friend’s disposable vape a few months ago for the first time and it felt like I had inhaled water, so it seems VG is still the hot thing",1
"I’m sure PG wasn’t good for me, and any flavoring was surely the worst thing, but I am convinced VG is dangerous and is coating people’s lungs.",2
The judge is still breaking over this during the resolution of the next case.,0
"LOL, what a dumdum, just sitting there with his mouth hanging open, like it never occurred to him that he shouldn’t let the judge see him driving when he’s charged with *driving on a suspended license*.

I’ve watched several videos with cases before this judge",1
He gets some real knuckleheads in his court,1
"Defendants, and lawyers too",0
"It’s kinda like the old TV show Night Court, only without a laugh track or staff of comedy writers to pinch up the dialogue.",1
Hol up,1
"Maybe John Popper shouldn't have given one of the absolute greatest vocal performances of all time on the recording   lol

God damn I love him and his incredible lungs and vocal cords .",1
"> Shows like COPS are basically, ""let's all laugh at this person for acting the way people are much more likely to act when they're poor and desperate and their lives are held together with duct tape""",2
"This feels in the same vein.

I remember an episode of COPS where the officer had to pull over in front of a house (that he wasn't even called to) because some skinny 120lb crackhead hit his 350lb wife's breaking point and she had him on his chest on their front walk hogtied with lamp cable.

The cop saw this and got her up off of him",2
"The guy was mean mugging the camera, her, the cop",2
He looked pissed,0
The wife wasn't having any more of him and pressed for DV saying that the next time would be similar,1
"The cop, for his part, couldn't stop laughing because she had hogtied him so professionally and thoroughly that he couldn't untie it and had to cut the guy loose.",1

And if you were you'd be a weird conversationalist,2

It's because they speak the way we write and we know only AIs do that or foreigners,0
If you learn a language by reading and writing it..,0
"Then learn how to speak it native speakers will say you sound ""formal"" in the same way these AIs sound like they are reading a smart freshman's 3 sentence written answers to a college exam question.",1
I can see why people would think this is weird but I don't think that kiss was meant to be sexual,2

Good news: taxi cabs have been around for over a century! Will the wonders of technology never cease?,1
