"> It was never the game that was the problem: it was the management who failed to put in place the correct governance.

I would argue the reason the game did not take of like P-GO did was an issue with the game.

I've said this before but when P-GO came out Pokémon trainers had 20 years of collecting under their belt",2
"Potterheads on the other hand had 20 years of reading under theirs.

You can't replace the pokémon by stickers based on the story and think readers will go crazy over collecting them",2
"The game loop needed to be story driven (which is why Hogwarts Mystery is still going strong, it's focused on a story)

At one point I even [suggested a different mechanic for the Foundable screen](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotterwu/comments/e94ptf/given_how_everyone_seems_to_love_oddities_because/) to give us more of a choice (and thus feel like we have influence in the wizarding world story).

Instead of always drawing the same spell, I added multiple spell options that take you down different paths (i.e",1
cautious approach or aggressive approach or ...) each leading to different sequences (so we'd still be spending some amount of energy battling each confoundable) with at the end either an extra reward (e.g,2
"+1 slytherin student) or a nerf (incendio would lose you the painting).

But these scenarios could even reward differently depending on your house (e.g",0
"a Gryffindor player would get a bonus reward if they triggered the banshee into a classic oddity encounter, a Ravenclaw would get a bonus by first using Wingardium Leviosa and only then using Incendio, ...).",1

"As someone running a sub for a game that’s had almost no content updates for years, I agree with archiving it.",2
A Harry Potter themed game from the Pokémon go people that sadly is no more,2
What is this game?,2
">I think the game loop was too much a copy of P-GO (with different graphics).

Personally, the main reason I stopped playing after just a short time was because the game required too much to be done with too little offered back to me",2
"In Pokémon Go, it was easy to accumulate the items I needed and although I hate a few things about the gameplay, it does work with something of a positive feedback loop",2
You can essentially play indefinitely if you're in the right area,1
This was NOT the case for Wizards Unite for me,0
Maybe I just didn't play enough to level up and enjoy certain benefits,1
Maybe I just didn't have enough locations added on my map,0
But I ran out of resources easily and didn't enjoy that at all,1
I've had this complaint with every single Wizarding World mobile game over the last few years,2
They keep adding these heavily restrictive energy constraints and there is no incentive to keep playing if you don't want to pay.,2
"lol, this aged like milk.",1
"> What's the gain of locking it? 

Not having other HP stuff blow in and pollute the sub.

> I don't know what the future will bring so who knows what reasons there might be to contact people here again for whatever reason?

There's been 2 threads since the game shut down 4 months ago.

Even if somebody made a thread to contact others it would barely be seen.

You'd better be of sending a DM (but if that dorsn't suit your needs you can always go through the steps to request and exception",2
"Sub is locked but can be unlocked)

> I don't see any harm in leaving it as it is? Whenever people want to change something the question should always be how the new situation would be objectively substantially better than the old situation",1
Something that is done way too little with too often very detrimental effects I'm afraid,2
Policy changes that turn out very bad and should be reversed but all too often aren't,2
"Most people can probably think of a few of those by themselves.

Which ones are you thinking of? (I guess you technically already gave one but that hardly qualifies as *a few*)

"Thanks for the suggestion! I did think about playing Pikmin but decided against it since it's very walking-based and I don't go out much, so it I would progess much in the game",1
"But it looks cute! With Potter and Pokemon, I can play while at home because I can reach an inn/PokeStop without going out.",1
"I remember distinctly i sent my mail on one of the last days available, mid-January.",1
Haha that would imply that I ever actually take the time to read license agreements!,1
"I got mine two days ago, so I will download and store it",0
I am glad they gave us this way to keep our memories of such good times.,1
"Did you notice agreeing to fitness data being shared to ""all Niantic games"" when you turned on Adventure Sync on?",0
I noticed that too,0
I can’t say why the data doesn’t go much before January (or December in my case) but perhaps they weren’t storing as much long-term data before the closure announcement,1
"As for the fitness in February, I play Ingress so perhaps it’s tied to other Niantic games, or the Adventure Sync is still on.",2
"I submitted mine on Jan 15 too, with final answer Feb 24",0
"I have two questions about FitnessData.txt:     
\-I only got data for 2022(jan/feb) - am I to believe they did not store this data for my entire playtime?    
\-Why are there datapoints for february (as lite as the 9th) when the game shut down Jan 31?",2
Haven't had time to play much mobile games but def thinking about breaking back out Ingress this summer if WU is truly dead,2
Ingress is/was a blast,0
Wish I could have enjoyed WU a little longer so I don't want to miss out on another crack at Ingress if it dies too,1
"Pretty surreal to read this given Pokemon Go in its early stage was a hot buggy mess with loads of trash talking by players.

Now it seems Pokemon Go has taken up the mantle of stable strong game with Harry Potter being a bit of a buggy mess with loads of trash talking by its players.

I guess that's how it goes sometimes lol.

Although tbh it's kinda lame to be happy it went under given it doesn't really benefit anyone going under, just sucks for the players who really did enjoy it.",1
People usually do.,2
"IGN :  HARLZA23

"Oh interesting, that’s pretty fun to have",1
"Account info, my friends list, gameplay times and locations (at least for the last three months), and amount of foundables obtained and items used.",2
"There’s a bunch of account info, friend lists, and so forth",0
"The best file is Gameplay.txt, which shows the number of encounters and returns for each foundable and items used.",1
Good to know,1
Thanks.,1
What is in the text files?,0
What kind of data did they give you?,1
You’re welcome,1
"I was sad last week during the full moon, thinking “werewolves” before I remembered",2
But I am having fun putting together my own mementos of the game.,1
They just have too much data to send,1
I received my data after ~45 days,0
Thank you!,0
"I believe I just sent an email to [privacy@nianticlabs.com](mailto:privacy@nianticlabs.com) with the gmail I used for the game, and my in-game username, and asked for my game data",2
"I tried to find the support page for it, but it looks like Niantic has taken down the HPWU support area.",2
How did you ask for It?,0
"I submitted mine on Jan 15, and they said it would take up to 30 days to process",0
Haven't seen anything yet,0
Hopefully they're just backlogged.,0
Yeah I was hoping i would see/ graph my trajectory after I hit 60.,0
You get all your stats in one text file,0
"Beside that, every logins and actions (gifting, inn / gh / fortress visits, encounters etc.), sorted by type in different files, with coordinates and timestamp, for a timespan cca 1 week.",0
You can find your Total XP in the Gameplay.txt file,0
"First few data are:   
""Your game play information for Harry Potter: Wizards Unite  
Start date: ----

Total XP:  ----""

and so on..",2
"vault items, badges, skills, potions brewed / used by type, spellcasts by type, masterful cast..",0
"a lot more, than we could see in-game.",1
"Yeah I’m sorry I didn’t even know what wu meant I just assumed it was another Harry Potter sub, why don’t you lighten up a bit and don’t worry about the little things in life like this, notice how most of the people just answered the question?",2
"Keep it civil and hufflepuffy, please",0
Not an excuse for posting in the wrong sub.,2

Same boat,0
Don’t care that much but it would have been fun to poke around it a bit,1
I’m actually more interested in what type of data they were collecting than my specific data,1
Does anyone have a summary of that?,0
"Me too.

I've tried Ingress and the Pikmin game, but they don't grab my attention in the same way as HPWU did.

And knowing that Niantic can so casually discard massive games like Catan and HPWU really doesn't make me want to invest more of my life in their other games",2
Please include a time zone in the buddy name,0

what.,0
wrong sub dummy.,2
"Indeed, I was trying to give the parent commenter the background to work that out, but not say it directly",1

And lighting everything up felt like the best way to go out.

"No, because Voldemort didn’t have a voice in this game.",2
thank you for the info.,0
There was a message from Niantic about 2 months ago,0
But there was also a due date,2
You can email privacy@nianticlabs.com and see if they can still help you maybe?,0
From where can we download it? I didn't know we can do that,0
Wish to have my data for sure.,1
"Jeez man thanks for sharing this, you definitely have a lot of solid arguments here and clearly know a lot more about HP than me lol",1

I thought the same thing the other night when I saw the almost full moon,1
Still in the mourning phase for sure!,1
>It’s weird for me to just see Pokemon Go now as the only game on my phone that I can interact with the real-world environment,2
"Sometimes it feels like I'm not productive enough when I go out.

Have you tried r/PikminBloomApp?

It’s like Pokémon GO with plants rather than pocket monsters",2
"Built on the same map as HPWU, but the points of interest are mushrooms and giant blooms.

Instead of walking x kilometers to unlock portkey portmanteaux, you walk x steps to sprout seedlings.

It’s difficult to get free coins",2
"Storage costs money rather than coins.

And a lot of my PoGo friends played Jurassic World Alive rather than HPWU.",1
I would have paid more attention to what foundables were in the fortresses and done more to get those - namely using more regular page runestones instead of the Brilliant ones because they were the only level 1's I had most of the time,1
I was nervous to try the higher level ones thinking they made the fortresses expontially harder,2
I also didnt realize that they gave more fragments and I would have been more intentional with what level fortress I played instead of sticking with my favorite every day for the majority of the time (Forest IV because I could solo it easily enough and it gave more regular house foundables,1
And I would have returned more than the 10 needed for the daily task every day but been more strategic about which I clicked on.,1
SAME,0
I don't think it's the killing curse in this scene,0
"Does Voldemort actually shout the words?  One of the assumptions of that curse is that it has to be spoken, after all.

In the book, Voldy only uses that curse twice at the Ministry, as I recall",0
"The first time it's at Harry, and a statue comes to life and blocks it, courtesy of (the just arrived) Dumbledore",1
"The second time it's at Dumbledore himself, and Fawkes flames in and takes it for him",0
"The rest of the time, they're using other magic",1
"In particular, there is a Water/Fire combat scene in the books, with what I think was actually our first glimpse of Fiendfyre, though it wasn't called that.

In the movies, there is a lot of flashing lights and sound effects, but very little spells shouted",1
"I think this particular scene is supposed to be the Fire/Water duel, as you can sort of see the water dripping down from the spells",1
"Also, Dumbledore's spell is red, like fire, and Voldy's is bluesih, like water",0
(At least I think that's the colors,2
"I am slightly color-blind, though, so I could be wrong.)  

&#x200B;

But if it is the Killing Curse, I don't think we really have to come up with the idea of special, incredible magic to figure out what happened, or throw in arguments about the Elder Wand being able to do things lesser wands cannot.

&#x200B;

SPOILERS AHEAD...and a LONG Response (Apologies in advance.)

&#x200B;

The killing curse is one of the most interesting spells in the series, when you consider what everyone assumes about it, versus what is actually true based on what happens in the series...and why the discrepancy exists",1
"There are a few basic truths:

1",2
It kills instantly if it strikes someone,0
2,0
"Its green

These two facts come from all Harry's memories and experiences throughout the series and are indisputable",2
"A few specific encounters give us a few more things we can assume are true:

3",1
"AK can be blocked by using the spell Expelliarmus at the exact moment it is cast, if a brother wand is being used",1
"(End of Goblet of Fire)

4",0
"AK can be blocked by physical objects being pushed/conjured into its path (End of Order of the Phoenix)

5",0
AK can be rebounded by a powerful protective charm fueled by self-sacrifice (Lily's sacrifice,1
"mentioned in practically every single book)

6",2
"AK can be rebounded by the Elder wand being used to shoot Expelliarmus at the exact moment that the curse is cast, while the wand is in the hands of the it's true master",1
"(End of Deathly Hallows)

&#x200B;

Then there are the assumptions made:

1",0
"Avada Kedavra must be spoken aloud, and cannot be used silently:  We never actually see anyone who uses it in the books that does not shout the words...but does that actually mean you need to shout the words, or are we just assuming?

2",2
"AK cannot be blocked, or dodged:  This is actually stated in Goblet of Fire...by Barty Crouch, JR",0
"For some reason, Harry and everyone else in that class (not to mention hundreds and hundreds of readers) seem to take this as the gospel truth from that moment on, even after discovering that it was a DEATH EATER who told them this",0
"(And the aforementioned readers insist that JKR makes a mistake later on, creating a paradox when it is in fact blocked.)  But the source of this idea is beyond unreliable",0
Barty Crouch JR has every reason to want a room full of bloodtraitors and mudbloods to think that they have no hope against that curse if it is cast at them or a loved one,1
"If you honestly believe that it can't be blocked, you might not even try...which would make things much, much easier for the Death Eaters",1
"(Not to mention, as noted above, that Lily, Dumbledore, and Harry himself all prove this statement absolutely wrong",2
"Not only can the Killing Curse be blocked, there are at least three ways to do it",2
This is NOT a paradox,0
"I would not trust a word Barty Crouch, JR told me, once I found out who he actually was",0
The man lied,0
"Plain and simple.)

3",2
"""You have to mean it to cast it.""  Again, the one who tells us this is Barty Crouch, JR",2
"And Bellatrix Lestrange tells us this about Cruciatus at the end of Order of the Phoenix, which SEEMS to re-emphasize the point",0
But neither source has any reason to tell the truth,0
"What's more, in the case of Cruciatus, at least, this is proved false at the end of Deathly Hallows",1
I refuse to believe that Harry Potter would suddenly become a sadistic torturer who wants someone to truly writhe in agony before him just because that someone spat on Professor McGonagall,0
"Harry was angry, yes",2
Absolutely devoted to the idea of torture to the point that he truly MEANT to use a curse that he KNOWS causes insanity?  No,1
The fact Harry can cast Cruciatus (and can cast Imperio as well) lends credence to the idea that you do NOT actually have to truly desire to commit murder or torture to cast an Unforgivable,1
"You only have to be angry, or desperate.

5",2
AK is one of the worse curses in existence:  No character actually tells us this,2
"It's called an Unforgivable, and everyone just assumes that it's one of the worst curses",2
"But is it?  OK, it kills instantly, and that's bad",2
But there are a lot of other curses we learn about in the course of the series that can kill,2
"(Sectumsempra, for one.)   Honestly, I think the Killing Curse might be one of the more merciful curses in the books",1
"Its quick, and (as far as we know) painless",1
"The extremely unpleasant wasting curse that attacked Dumbledore in Half-Blood Prince is not quick, and Sectumsepra is definitely not painless",2
"And if you really DO need to mean it in order to cast it (after all, we never see anything to suggest that you don't, when it comes to AK, only when it comes to Cruciatus), then that makes it even LESS bad, not more:  You have to WANT to commit murder with your whole being, so you're not going to accidentally kill someone you never truly meant to hurt",2
We know for a fact that that is not the case with Sectumsempra,0
"(Draco's unfortunate encounter with Harry in Half-Blood Prince taught us that.)  So, if you have to mean it to cast AK, then the person who casts it might themselves be a nasty piece of work, but the curse itself?  Maybe not.

6",2
Its powerful,1
"Again, no one tell us this",0
We just assumed it based on everything else we were told and/or assumed,0
"But is it?  How much magical power does it really take to stop a heart?  A nice jolt of electricity could do that, after all",1
"Also, we KNOW it can be blocked, and rebounded",0
"Doesn't that suggest its weaker than people think?  And if some of the assumptions made about AK are in fact true, then the idea it is powerful becomes even more problematic:  If it is true that you have to mean it, and can't cast it by accident, doesn't that mean it takes more concentration and willpower to cast...suggesting that AK is, in fact, a weaker curse, that needs all the help it can get?  And if you have to shout it aloud...doesn't that mean, again, it is a weaker curse, needing an actual shout to focus your magic enough to cast it?

&#x200B;

In other words, the assumption that the Killing Curse is an extremely powerful, unblockable curse that would take equally powerful magic to have any hope of defeating it could be plain wrong",1
"It may not be that powerful at all, making it easy for any wizard who realizes this (like Dumbledore) to counter it",1
"And even if that is not true, we KNOW that AK can be blocked at least three different ways, including the relatively simple method of summoning an object in its path",2
"So why can't it be blocked by more ways than that?  Maybe it doesn't take self-sacrifice, the Elder wand, or a brother wand to block it at all, just the luck and/or skill of casting any other spell at the exact same time the curse is cast...and maybe that is what we are seeing here, in this movie scene.",1
I’m glad I wasn’t the only one.,1
Ugh,0
No,0
"By the time I got around to it, the deadline to request data had passed.",0
I didn’t BUT now I will,0
Thanks!,1
"If this game was part of your daily routine, then I'd kindly want to recommend you getting back to Pokemon GO! (Or creating an account, if you've never played it before)",2
It has improved a ton since its early days,1
"It has tons of new stuff to do, in both daily, weekly, and monthly doses",1
"Improvements since the first year include Legendary Raids, real-time PvP combat with Ranked Matchmaking, daily streaks, battles against Team Rocket, and plenty of QoL features and enhancements",1
"Give it a GO, maybe? :p 

Here's my friend code if you want to try it out",0
"This will give us both some rewards! HDKP4YYF9  

Alternatively, if you can't enter the code, you can try with [this](https://pokemongolive.com/refer?code=HDKP4YYF9&source=INVITE_PAGE) link.

Play safely!",1
"For me, the game couldn’t have ended at a better time",0
"Literally that afternoon, my mother-in-law’s home caregiver called and said she couldn’t make it to her (they both live in Ottawa) because of the convoy invasion, and I decided to go there to help her",1
"I’ve been so busy that I’ve barely even thought of the game, never mind played it.",2
I thought the same thing last night! I found a great YouTube channel called [the HP:WU Preservation Project](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtj17BiEwH1kHoeudwKaSfw) which is aiming to catalogue the game’s animations,1
"There isn’t one for the werewolf oddity yet, though.",0
I had several surgeries over the time the game was deleted and couldn't go outside for weeks,2
Today was the first day I went somewhere else than the hospital again and as soon as I sat on the bus I opened the game because I always played on the bus 😣,2
I received it but didn't understand,0
Waiting for my son to come home from college to break it down for me,2
Seems to have a lot of locations and each time we went to greenhouse/inn.,1
Same,0
Really mourning the game.,2
"I sent my request in, but I never got my data",0
Oh well.,1
You reminded me to go and check my emails,0
So I’ve downloaded my data,0
I doubt I’ll ever look at it again tbh,0
😄,0
The death of HPWU has really killed my passion for PoGo too,1
"While I still play a bit out of habit, it's actually been nice to go out and not feel FOMO if my phone isn't always open.",1
I did the same thing this week,0
It is sad that it was something that I could look forward to by looking at the moon.,2
Haven't deleted it yet either,0
It's hard to let go.,2
"It's okay, it's weird for me to just see Pokemon Go now as the only game on my phone that I can interact with the real-world environment",2
Sometimes it feels like I'm not productive enough when I go out.,2
He wrote SSBB on the back of his wand hand,0
TedPomfrey was such a reliable and generous gifter to me,1
I've no idea where we friended up from - could have been here under my old handle maybe? You sent me so many gold gifts in the last weeks that enabled me to get more keys and open enough dragon eggs to complete those pages - thank you \*so\* much!,1
"I remember your post, and did the same thing here",0
"It was great to see it all lit up and spinning, I closed the app before midnight, so in my head I imagine it's all still going.",1
"r/TheSilphRoad is great for PoGO info, they post about events and lots of know-how if you have questions",1
"Lots of small community groups are all over too, could help you if you found one",2
"It was the one thing I found hard about HPWU, a few in my local PoGO group were into it so we'd get together early on for CD's and such, but most people fizzled out of playing WU",1
"Pokemon Go has lots of different aspects that are fun, will be more noticeable once Covid clears away",1
Community days are big - there are around 1000 people who would regularly gather at a big local spot here to play,0
"Then you get into trading, group raids (and raid-trains on event days), and pvp tournaments that are fun",1
You can be as social as works for you with it,1
"Gifts from friends are a great way to get more items and special eggs, and friend increases are a fantastic way to get more XP as you move forward",1
"Remote playing is also fun - I'm in Vancouver but joined both a Brussels and an Aussie discord group, so lots of remote raids from those places (great to trade for distance with locals, too)",1
"If you're a bit walker/explorer, you can nominate interesting places to be stops",1
This is especially great if you are a rural player or don't have a lot of stops/gyms in your area,1
"2 years ago a new stop appeared that I can reach from my home, which has made the game a lot easier to play (especially when it's bad weather out and you just need to get your daily spin, or you need more gifts to send to friends).",2
"Not related but I found it funny that they can do non verbal spells, but Voldemort has to yell the killing curse.",1
"Movies deviate from the books a lot and I’m doing so sometimes don’t make sense, have continuity issues or miss vital parts",1
I love the movies but they’re a shadow on the books.,1
Yeah same actually,0
That's how I do it lol,1
I kinda like that I can enjoy it two different ways too.,1
"Yeah I think you’re right, I guess it’s just a really cool fight and I should enjoy it for that",1
With the Elder Wand,0
"It looks really similar to the priori incantatum representation in the movie, if anyone could force that to occur it would be him",1
"And as inaccurate as this is it does make for a dramatic scene, maybe they just chose to do it a little different for artsy reasons? 

Last point I like to think about is these are the two greatest wizards of the age, and among the most skilled ever",1
"I don't know all the spells they use but Its not outside of Canon to expect they could be doing magic no one ever expected, knows about, or could repeat",1
I hate hand wavium to explain things to but in this specific case it kinda makes sense,2
Ok thanks lol,1
"It’s annoying people haven’t said this before because all I’ve got is “The killing curse is unblockable and he dodged it” and shir like that, like bro he clearly didn’t dodge it he used expelliarmus or some kinda stunning shit",2
Its dumbeldore,0
"It had been announced that The Task Force Times would go down when the game finished.

(I tried to archive some of the pages onto the Wayback machine, with very limited success)",2
Aw that’s sad if true,2
Wouldn’t expect them to host it forever though.,0
that is AWESOME!,1
Check out u/Stefiman2’s [awesome PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n828yesQX45IfDWGL5RKFEjPi-d7y02Q/view) for the story plus much more.,1
"I wish I'd taken more screenshots.

Not that I'm complaining: I was VERY lucky to live so close to so many Inns, Greenhouses and Fortresses",1
And I had a great time playing the game,1
"But when I go for a walk now, I always think of all those landmarks",0
"And it's like I'm still walking the HPWU map.

It is now available as Wildspot AR at least on Android,1

"The secretary looking chick was the bad guy all along, but she had a change of heart at the final end",2
It’s a long haul,2
I’ve been playing for four years now and I’m in year 7,0
The story is not over yet because they’ve really stretched it out to make every single penny they can.,2
It's very ideal for people who have to deal with harsh weather,1
You can go for a walk and gather everything after you get back inside,0
No need to freeze your fingers or get your phone wet.,2
Personally I'm just enjoying having my phone battery life back,1
Not planning on replacing HPWU with any geolocation-based game because of that,2
Enjoying puzzle games like Wordle though.,1
Besides Pikmin Bloom (for walking IRL) I am also playing Genshin Impact (for running not-IRL),0

r/HPHogwartsMystery has lots of resources for new and old players,1
"But no, it doesn't compare to WU, which I still miss",0
It does give you some HP stuff (the graphics are pretty good) and you can play here and there since you have to wait for your energy to fill up.,1
These do not compare but I am still playing Hogwarts Mystery (year 6 here) and Harry Potter Puzzles and Spells (like candy crush but Harry Potter-themed).,0

Catan still working? I heard it is closed too,2
This sounds so fun!,1
"Golf Battle: https://mcgam.es/2NPLGfp

If you guys want a game that kills time and doesn’t have any ads (unless you literally pick to watch an ad), this game is addicting",2
Pikmin Bloom,0
Is Sky a game that you can play while walking?,2
I’ve been playing Hogwarts mystery since it came out and I enjoy it,1
The stories generally pretty good,1
It’s pre Harry Potter so doesn’t include the trip unlike wizards unite but we see a lot of other familiar faces.,1
"I am semi-rural, so no buses",0
I am getting plenty to fight from home though,0
Nice spawn rate!  I hope you enjoy it also,1
"My understanding is that eventually I will be able to play with other friends who are in different areas, like playing on the Knight Bus was.",1
If you are near a National Park there is one they are developing that will let you fight monsters in the parks after solving educational puzzles to unlock the portals,1
Doesnt have a final name yet but I got to test it because I work with kids on STEM with a nonprofit and they were looking for educators and other youth workers to give input,2
It was really fun and actually teaches you real world stuff too,1
But it is only playable in the parks and not all of them yet even as a beta.,1
Enjoy! There are bosses that start showing up at level 25,1
"Try to ride a bus or play as passenger, and kill easy bosses",1
I Just hit T10 Lvl 225 and am still loving it.,1
"I've been playing Sky: children of the light, it's really fun!  Also still working on Pokemon Go.",1
I only stand for 2 days,0
Haha,1
Yes! I have gotten my Mage to Level 16 in the short time I have been playing it,0
"I love the old time graphics, and even leave the music on",1
And it uses the same real world map that HPWU used.,1
"I picked up Pikmin, but I don’t like it",0
"Not enough to do, and it’s more repetitive than WU",1
"I’ve been a Pokémon Go player since launch, so I started playing that a little more",1
"I had given it up for WU, since they reduced the spawns",0
Still trying to find a replacement 😕,0
I swore I wouldn't but I started PoGO,0
Not bad I guess but nowhere near as good as WU and I definitely play way less,1
"Whereas I played WU throughout most of the day and never missed an event after the first few months with PoGo I open the game once, maybe twice a day",2
Have yet to get out and explore pokestops or anything and run out of pokeballs way too fast,1
I also play Hogwarts Mystery and HP puzzles and spells a good bit if you're looking for something specifically Harry Potter related,1
Eh I lasted like 3 days and lost interest,0
Orna and Pokemon Go,0
I have some close friends playing Orna but it doesn't really demand that you walk the way WU and Pokemon Go do,2
Orna  with a side of Pikmin Bloom,0
"I still play Ingress too, but there is not as much to do there for rurals",1
"Orna is really nice in that it doesn't matter if you are in a populated area or not, it will still spawn monsters! It is also turn based, so you don't have to hope no one tries to talk to you while you are trying to do a dodgy adversary battle",1
"I do still miss WU, but I am progressing much faster in Orna now that I am not swapping back and forth xD",0
I'm really enjoying Walkr,1
Its a really cute space exploration game,1
It encourages walking to boost timers but isn't location dependent,0
Highly  recommend,1
It's also been around for a while.,0
Minecraft Earth and Catan: World Explorers,0
There are outfits to collect based on where the pikmin was found.,0
Omg I was not aware of the Simpson game.,2
this is fantastic news,1
Wow there ya have it,1
Reddit-searching abilities on LOCK,0
Thank you so much from someone who does not understand this app and would not have otherwise found this!! 🥲🤠,1
"r/PikminBloomApp

It has several advantages over HPWU",0
"For example, you walk x steps to grow a Pikmin, rather than y kilometers to unlock a portkey portmanteau.

Also, you interact with the screen far less during your walks",2
"And you can do more from home than HPWU.

Like Pokémon GO and Ingress, Pikmin Bloom is built on the same map as HPWU.",1
Wowwww bless you this looks perfect!!! 😍,1
"I really like Orna.

..",1
And still play GO here and there.,0
"Lollll dude amen 🥲 is there still a collecting component to it, or mostly just centered around the walking?",1
"I haven’t heard of this, will definitely look into it 🧐 thanks for the recommendation!",1
Hehe well I’d be interested to hear your final verdict! I certainly might as well see what’s up 👀,1
went back to PoGo and Simpsons Tapped Out,0
Pikmin Bloom...not harry potter but cute and rewards walking,1
Very low effort compared to HP haha,1
Also not ever allowing myself to spend money on a phone game again 😬,2

It's was a joke,0
Lighten up.,0
Orna,0
Check out r/OrnaRPG,0
I started playing Hogwarts Mystery,0
It’s one of those games where you have to wait for tasks to be available and wait for energy to complete them,1
Jury’s still out.,0
Have you tried Jurassic World Alive?,1
"Huh, I never thought about it that way",0
I didn’t realize it was impossible to enjoy a game and life at the same time.,2
🤯 thanks for opening my eyes with this insightful response!!,1

It really was! It was always so exciting to go to an area and see something lit up,1
I went to the Old Town area near me about a week after the end was announced and a few of the inns had DDs on them,2
It was just so heartwarming to know there was someone else playing until the end.,0
Well there goes my weekend.,0
Yes I know what you mean,2
At least as a rural player I was never in a lock down where I couldn't go out and walk.,2
pre-AS portkeys had to be planned out ahead of time and it was a pain in the ass,2
"Couldn't get out and play as much as I would've liked, but when I did hit spots with lots of foundables and POIs, it was great.",1
I know that issue,0
Day one player and a rural player,0
I did a lot of traveling to get mine done.,1
"since day one, but i got the unlucky draw of both living and working in places with no natural foundables outside of the tonics so I barely managed to make level 42.",1
That stinks,0
I had all the regular pages to gold and the 1920 pages,0
They were the last ones I got to gold,0
How long had you been playing?,2
Hogwarts Express in the fortress,0
about thirty minutes til midnight it occurred to me that I was actually really fucking close to getting that page and the page with Knights Bus to Silver,1
"Got the Express, but opted to keep playing for the Bus instead of placing",0
Thats when I got the server error.,0
I googled Harry Potter Dictionary and this popped up: https://www.lancsngfl.ac.uk/curriculum/literacy/lit_site/html/fiction/harry_potter/,0
The last one I actually got was Dumbledore’s memory cabinet,0
"I started trying for the ogre with the dragon egg, but then I realized I was never going to stop if I didn’t force myself to stop, so I force-closed the game to end it on my own terms.",2
Which website do you use? Because I might need it as well,0
Wow this was tricky!,1
Yes I have,0
I also have a tab open for a Harry Potter dictionary to help me out because it’s hard sometimes to think of 5 letter words 😂,2

I clicked on all the Apple Rubber ads,0
That should have paid a few bills.,2

Quidditch Harry for me,0
I was good with that.,1
I opened it on a backup phone I hadn't updated yesterday,0
To my surprise it said my version was out of date and directed me to the app store to update,0
"I didn't try to update because I know if I did I would just get the farewell screen you posted.

Still in denial phase I suppose",0
I doubt I will ever be angry about it though I understand even though it impacted a lot of people it was a game made by a for profit company and had to end sometime.,2
Agreed,0
"It is a significant loss for many players, and it cannot be replaced by a different game",1
"It’s losing the community, too.",0
There was more than one announcement and they didn’t match,1
Thanks for putting out this idea,1
"Seeing it this way will hopefully help me overcome my depression, post WU sadness",0
"Yes, you are right",1
"They are still there, but now all these spots are concealed by the same magical wards that shroud the Leaky Cauldron in Charing Cross road, Diagonally and Knockturn Alley in London and the village of Hogsmeade and Hogwarts castle from the eyes of the mundane, the Muggles, the No-Majs.",1

"To start with, there's no story in PoGo",0
It's just a sticker collecting game,2
Which is really not that interesting,1
"Also, it makes no difference if you participate in a PoGo event or not, whilst in HPWU it was all about the event rewards: spell books, restricted spell books, gold coins, silver keys etc.",0
"Nice, I'm glad you got him.",1
Nice,1
I got the 1920 pages all to gold in the last days of the game,2
I had all the regular pages to gold.the only ones I didn't get all to gold was the advanced adversary pages,0
I got my 2nd gold key and I pretty much quit them,1
I had the regular adversary pages all to silver.,0
Young Remus Lupin,1
"I admit I was looking for him, as Remus is my favorite character, and young Remus was the only version in the game",1
"He popped up almost as I was losing hope, and I was able to return him one last time",1
So I have the memory of my favorite character bowing goodbye,1
A nice way to end the game,1
"(I would have been happy with Sirius, too, for much the same reason, but young Remus was perfect.)",1
I had all but 2 registry pages to gold,0
One of the silvers needed Seamus Finnegans,0
I’ve been trying to strategically trace charm that one for a couple weeks with minimal success,1
Then at about 10 minutes before midnight I got the last 2 fragments,0
It was a nice sendoff.,1
Me too.,0
"Thanks for the suggestion, but I lost interest in PoGo after they added the extra 10 levels",1
"I worked out it would take me 20 years to complete all those, so now I just play that game very casually.

I can't help but wonder what will happen when Niantic pull the plug on PoGo..",2
Nothing lasts forever.,0
"For my last, I caught the snitch",0
Nice,1
I wish I had taken screen shots that last day.,0
Mine was a vanishing cabinet,0
I only know because I was screen recording before midnight and had 2 foundables on the map when I'd finished going through all my stuff,0
The first was a rememberall and then the cabinet.,1

Quidditch Captain Harry,0
I liked casting that particular spell and it seemed like a good one to go out on,1
"I still had lots of traces popping up from a TTD but I really needed to get to sleep, so I just chose that one.",1
I deleted the app immediately after I saw that past 12:01 am,2
Of course I did take a screenshot shot of that final page,0
Might as well rip the BandAid off even though it hurt then deal with the grief afterwards.,0

I got the horned serpent,0
"Was quite happy with that, my old friend who got me through the difficult early times of the game",2

My grocery shopping was way quicker because I didn't walk up and down every aisle clocking distance.,0
I don't know :(,0
I was peeking in on all available foundables to see them one last time,1
I played until I fell asleep with the phone inmy hand after 1am,0

Sorry you ended with the hag,2
Definitely creepy.,2
Oh wow,1
That was quick of them.,1

Quidditch Harry,0

Its amazing how much I played without even realizing it.,1
Yea better than the Hag,1

Fawkes,0
I thought it was a good one to end on,1
Yea I had like 6 or 7 gold gifts I earned that last day,0

It was great,1
"Fittingly enough, Voldemort because I had a dark mark going",1
"As far as ""regular"" foundables it was either the Vipertooth or Opaleye, maybe even the three headed dog",1

Ignore them,0
They've been shitposting on a ton of WU threads.,0

All of the quiet moments,0
Taking a walk?  Check the portkeys,0
Riding the bus?  Playing all the time,0
There is definitely a gap,0
"On the plus side, I’m on phone less…",2
"And now that page saying the game closed is gone now too, all links to the forums bring up the default ""site can't be reached"" error from web browsers.",2
"I do this several times a day, I'm still in denial mode.",0
ok?,1
That's it!  Yes ⚡,0
Certainly something I'm curious myself!,1
Interesting,1
I wonder if they will find the demo to skew older and female,1
(that is my theory as to why I enjoyed the community around the game so much -- I'm older and female),1
I would've thought the forum would at least still be there to share memories,2
Makes me wonder about this one,0
Thank you for compiling these! [spits on Pettigrew one last time for being the sole holdout on gold],0
They stuck around for a few days after closure but they’re off now I guess.,2
I feel you too,0
You are not alone,0
"Walking at night around our streets I never was alone, always a pixie, erkling, centaur, vampire, werewolf, dragon, baby beast, Snatcher or Death Eater or whoever was waiting around the next corner.

In my head I keep seeing the world, the WU map, filled with locations I used to visit, all those guesthouses, greenhouses and fortresses",1
"I cherished sending and receiving gifts, I really enjoyed all those postcard glimpses of places far away which other WU players sent me.

I'm sad too",1
I'm missing WU every minute of every day now,2
WU is tied in with just so many memories,1
"The many bad and few good ones.

Like other people, I absolutely KNOW that playing WU and the WU community helped me, us, through the last few years which were just absolutely horrible in our real life, full of trouble, job loss, frustration, helplessness, isolation, cabin feever, misery, sorrow, grief and funerals.",2
Thanks for posting all these,1
There are so many I never got to see filled in.,1
"The song for the greenhouses was the same as the inns, right? If so, it’s [Diagon Alley and the Gringotts Vault](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=u0WTsW1iXos).",1
Well the FAQ that the game has now shows the same email address I listed above for data requests,2
I waited until near the end because I wanted my complete data not missing the last couple of weeks,1
I don't know how long they will honor requests but seeing it now in the FAQ makes me more hopeful I will get my data.,1
"Question: In what sense is Pokemon Go ""boring"" and HPWU is not?

I've played HPWU almost every day until the end",2
"But even long before WB started doing constant Brilliant and Adversary events nonstop, the game ran stale pretty quick",1
"After reaching Gold in all pages and green-starring most of them, reaching level 60, completing the SOS tree, and maxing one or two professions, there wasn't a lot more to do",1
"Other than doing some hardcore, repetitive grinding, that is",2
"If you ask me, the last, actually exciting addition to the game, was the Tonic for Trace Detection.

I don't know when was the last time you've played Pokemon Go",2
"But the very lacking, incomplete beta of a game that PoGo was in it's first years was very different of the game that is today",2
"It has plenty of stuff to do, for all kind of players, from casual to hardcore, and from ""just enjoying playing"" to ""full completionism"" kind of players.",1
"If this game was part of your daily routine, then I'd kindly want to recommend you getting back to Pokemon GO! (Or creating an account, if you've never played it before)",2
It has improved a ton since its early days,1
"It has tons of new stuff to do, in both daily, weekly, and monthly doses",1
"Give it a GO, maybe? :p  
Here's my friend code if you want to try it out",0
"This will give us both some rewards!
HDKP4YYF9

Play safely!",1
"I get the reasoning for being bored with Pokemon Go, but if you're looking for something to do while you're out and about it might be worth another look",2
"Not only is there an actual, in-person community just about everywhere, but the gotta-catch-em-all mechanic actually makes sense in terms of the game",2
"Also, their research events are low-key enough that you can complete them on your own schedule or just ignore them entirely",1
And Community Day only takes a couple hours!,0
I have the music from inside the greenhouse,0
I'm not sure when in the movie it plays,2
I'm more of a Harry Potter book person,1
Got sad listening to it just now.,2
I feel really sorry for all you guys playing daily and loving the game,2
I did expect WU to get shut down eventually,2
I started to play WU at day one,0
"My phone at the time didn't have gyroscope, so couldn't access portrays",0
"Quit the game when the first event dropped and I realised I can't participate because of that.

A year ago I've got a new phone, with gyroscope, and immediately decided to jump back into WU",2
Personally it was a disappointment for me,2
"Partially because collecting stickers didn't feel like HP experience for me, mostly because I've felt constantly cheated by the game",2
"I'm playing PoGo too, and when I curve throw into a green pokemon, it's getting caught in 99% cases",2
"When I was doing perfect spell on a green foundable in WU it was getting caught in 75% cases at best, and very often running after first failed attempt",1
Add the aggressive monetization to it and I've felt that the game is just an excuse to get me pay money,2
"I've quit for good a month or two after returning.

WU could've been a great game, if instead of copying PoGo it would've been design to fit the theme of being a wizard in magical world",1
"I still blame WB for forcing the monetization policy (PoGo is much better in this regard, and all HP mobile games I'veplayed are like this: minimum effort/a clone of something else and a lot prompts to pay them)",1
"Who knows if WB didn't order PoGo clone from Niantic and weren't willing to pay for designing something new.
I'm pissed and wasted potential this game had",2
"And sad, because I don't think there will ever be a dev brave enough to try again.",1
"I think that was The Chess Game, though there may have been another track as well, I'm trying to remember",2
I might look for YouTube videos to remind me,0
I had quidish Harry as well.,0
Aww.,1

The Ministry of Magic track from Order of the Phoenix i think was used for some traces,1
The Quidditch Match from the Philosopher's Stone was in the waiting area of the Knight's Bus..,0
Not sure on the rest but I'm pretty sure the music that played when you open a gift and open a trunk was never a track from a released soundtrack and I was always curious about it and miss it already.,1

"The other half and I did some shopping yesterday and I had several 'I should turn on HP, oh wait...' and 'I could be opening so many portkeys right now' moments",1
I just don't need any more reminders and I don't see myself ever getting back into PoGo because there are always so many things going on,1
It's just too much for me to keep track of and the aesthetic is no longer appealing after the experience in HPWU.,1
Maybe put what you have so far into a public google doc and post a link…,1

Hi! 42RandomDent here,0
Thank you for playing until the end with me!,0
I agree,0
"I think a lot of the core issues with WU probably came from WB (poor monetization, time locked story, SO MANY BUGS! etc)",1
They figured that between the HP IP and PoGo concept the game would be a cash cow even if they half-assed it,2
"Still, Niantic has definitely showed their issues",0
I feel like they want to focus on AR but PoGo was way more successful than anticipated,1
The whole AR scan for pokestops is just getting players to do the mapping work for free,1
"PS: Just to be clear, my jabs at WB are for management not the people ACTUALLY working on the game",2
Its clear there were many people who put their heart and soul into the world we all love,1
I just think they were limited by higher-ups that had ZERO clue how to make a successful mobile game.,1
I saw your original post and just loved the idea,1
I planted stuff in the greenhouses I visited most.,1
I decided on the last day that I just wanted to get all the lethals and all the dragons to silver,0
"Lucius nearly eluded me as did the last horntail fragment, but I got them to silver and then stopped trying",1
I could not look at Peter's face anymore.,0
"I don't know, I've been feeling like Niantic bit off more than they can chew (and more than they're even interested in- they seem like they want to be an AR company more than a game company) but I do hold them accountable for the toxic elements of their games that have gone unaddressed for so long.",1
Yeah I went to my mom 20 min after midnight and showed her the game screen,2
"""See this game? Remember how I played it? They are shutting it down today",2
"And if I do this..."" (claiming daily rewards) ""...see, I can't log in anymore.""",0
"\*A set of robes fly off the shelf and land in your user flair\*

Wonderful, those look very good on you, dear.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically",1
Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/harrypotterwu) if you have any questions or concerns.*,0
/*Accio Ravenclaw flair,0
I got two notifications over night as well,0
I just laughed and cleared them,1
"If only I had not collected my daily task rewards, I might have still been playing at 6 am like some other people were.",2
"I was definitely surprised at how sad I felt as it all ended and that goodbye screen came up, and I’m not a huge HP fan either.",2
Like Aslan telling Lucy she’s too old.,1
describes it perfectly,1
I’m gonna miss this game.,2
I gave up on adversaries,0
Found the basic ones really boring,2
Got them all to bronze and decided that was enough! I did like the lethals though.,0
"Let me be clear, my exit from the Niantic 'verse is not vindictive at all",1
I have no bad feelings towards them at all,2
"Am I disappointed? Oh hell yeah, I feel like they just kind of abandoned us.",2
My exit has more to do with lack of interest in their current projects,1
"Ingress digressed into a hostile stalker game, Pokemon is boring, and so on..",2
I loved the story style of WU,1
I wish Hanke and the team the best,1
"And if come up with something as interesting and engaging as WU in the future, I'll probably check back in.",1
"I always thought as the troll longing for a loved one, maybe the desire to have a mate, or perhaps longing for the presence of a lost family member like how Harry saw his parents in the mirror.

I never saw it from this this perspective and I love the idea.",1
"great story, thanks for sharing",1
nice gifts.,1
I only ever saw 5 mirrors of erised,0
"No matter how many of the others I got on the page, I was never able to get it out of that first frame.",1
https://youtu.be/UcZzlPGnKdU,0
"I understand how you feel, and have been wondering if there might be some kind of anti-Niantic backlash",1
"I'm similarly disappointed, but I don't think this was entirely a Niantic decision",2
"I think WB were promised Pokemon Go revenues which never materialised.

&#x200B;

John Hanke has spoken publicly about the difficulties of having two software companies involved in the same game (that's actually a management problem, not a development problem) but clearly there were issues with the quality of the code changes, the (obvious) lack of QA testing and the increasingly bad community liaison and communication.

&#x200B;

It was never the game that was the problem: it was the management who failed to put in place the correct governance",2
"And now Niantic and WB have both invested $millions in a game which no longer exists.

&#x200B;

Way to go.",2
That was a fantastic Portkey location,1
Really nicely done.,1
Your experience in the chambers was so similar to mine,0
It was really fun,1
I also loved playing with randoms on the knight bus,1
I never did join a discord for it.,0
I still have it,0
I guess I should delete it but I wonder what it will show some time later,0
"You're welcome, friend, and thank you, too",1
❤️,0
I did the same,0
It was nice to have teammates again,1
I didn't play a lot pre-pandemic but the Knight Bus was my favorite thing about the game,1
Those magical times when a bunch of randoms (no Discord for me) would show up together and surprise each other by all just doing what we needed to do,1
"I enjoyed the strategy, peril, and teamwork of it",1
"I started out playing (badly, until reading posts here)* as an Auror, then maxed Professor second and enjoyed that even more",1
"I finally maxed Magi in the last few weeks and played my first Dark V in that role last night, plus several rounds as Auror and Professor",2
It's easy (although maybe a little less fun? I enjoyed the close calls sometimes) when you have potions to burn,1
I don't know how many strong invigorations and potents I went through yesterday but I had more than I needed and it was fun to be generous,1
"Auror: Have some focus! Hexes all around! First strikes galore! Prof: Immediate shields and proficiency for everyone whether or not you passed me focus! Det hexes abound! Magi: Umm, I think this is where I click to cast Bravery? Done before any elites on board, and I shall heal you all immediately upon injury whether you really need it or not!  

Somehow never happened but once or twice in passing but would've been fun to meet up in the Knight Bus with some of the random Reddit-generated friends whose gifts I really appreciated (though at times stressed out about appropriately reciprocating!) over the years",1
"And in some cases the past few days, as I added a few of you this week just to send XP",2
"Since this has apparently become my farewell post/comment, I'll add that I ended by defeating Voldemort, and probably would've gotten those stupid dragon egg pages to gold with one more day",2
"F the adversary pages but I at least placed each image once.

TL;DR: Godspeed and thank you, kind internet strangers",1
"*Always lurking, never ever posting, hence brand new account",1
"A long time ago I spent a ton of time stockpiling strong invigoration potions in hopes that they would introduce new fortress levels, and thinking I might need to help some teams along if that ever happened.

As a result I had over 100 potions each good for 4 focus",1
"It turned out that on the last day, *everything* got a deterioration hex.",0
I went out teaming in Dark V too,2
The teams were good,1
"As long as we had three people, we all went",2
I burned up potents like I had coins to burn! Knocking out my opponents with one swipe (after our prof put the proficiency charm on the team)! It was a blast,2
"Thanks, everyone",1
"It was a good community closure, even if I didn’t get to chat with anyone",1
We all knew our jobs and just did them.,0
That was mine too,0
Sigh.,0
I got the notification that my Potent Exstimulo was done about 3 hours ago,0
"I’ve been careful to avoid clearing the notification but just in case, I took a screenshot so I remember.",2
Me too! It was kinda fun to use potions like there no tomorrow.,1
You've articulated so we'll all the emotions I'm having over the game,2
"I'm in mourning over the loss of so many things that the game was, it's good to know I'm not alone in how I feel.",1
Feels so weird not having HP on my phone.,2
Aw my husband and I were the same (altho his Pokédex is alive and well),1
"We’d yell across the house whenever there were rare foundables at home, when driving passenger was on HPWU duty, and we had an alarm that went off at 11:45p to collect our daily rewards (most days, including yesterday, I’d fall asleep and he’d have to do it for me)",1
"It was the only thing we really played together, and I’ll also miss it very much.",1
The game was losing money,2
I'm kinda surprised that they didn't shut down one day.,1
"The only pages I didn’t gold and max the level were adversaries cause, I just didn’t enjoy them, at all.",2
Swapping gifts with friends in other countries was one of my favorite things,1
"I just liked seeing the places that they frequented, and got to know them enough that if they sent me a gift from another place I knew they were traveling",1
"I had friends in the UK, Germany, India and a lot of other places",2
"I felt little bereft today,..",2
"I opened the game at Midnight and it gave me the daily gift and let me pick up an item on the map, so I thought I would be able to play today",2
But next time I opened it I got the shut down message,2
Thanks for posting this!  I was going to go thru and save everything but got busy yeasterday,1
Thought we still had today....bummer,0
Don't be embarrassed,0
These feelings are real,1
We understand,0
You're completely right,1
"This game has seen us through fun times - vacations, jobs, picnics..",2
The before times,0
Then 2020 happened...,0
And the game just made the loveliest pivot to support us,2
Because they got it,0
They understood that we wanted to play,0
And it HAS been a great support for so many of us during these dark times when we haven't been able to do normal,1
There's no shame in mourning a mobile app,0
Not when it qualified as a hobby,0
Or a social outlet,1
Or a support network.,0
Thanks for the ride!,1
I needed a single Goblet of Fire -- a severe-level foundable -- to turn my last regular page gold,2
Never saw a single one,2
"I'd be angrier about it if I didn't also need about a dozen broomsticks on the same page, which I hadn't seen in months.

I wish I could say I was surprised, but given that's how the entire game went I'd be lying if I did.",2
That actually makes me feel slightly better,1
Like it's all still there .,0
but just slightly out of view,2
🥺,0
When I was in this one I didn’t realize I could look around - I just looked out the window,0
Thank you for posting this!!,0
I was thinking about my favorite memories from playing this game,1
So many good times with my group of friends as the friendly magizoologist,1
"Fan fest was one of the best, but the one that really stood out was opening up the game one morning to see our group photo taken at the fest blow up everyone’s phone! I even had some other IRL friends add me once they saw me not knowing either of us played! Just wanted to share",1
Thanks for the memories!,1
I didn't start playing at the beginning so the are a lot of these images I've never seen,1
Thanks!,1
"I made a final recording of everything I could at ~5:30AM, but then I realized that I was just delaying the inevitable so I force-closed the game myself to stop me from playing.",2
Update: I did it 4 more times in the next 2 hours (including 5 minutes after my original post) and eventually decided it was time to delete the app,1
"It was surprisingly hard to do, considering it’s nothing but the goodbye letter now",1
But it just felt wrong.,2
"Thank you for the kind words, person involved was gotten out of the bad situation and no one got hurt thankfully so yes much less stress now.

This is part of what makes the game closing down so sad",2
"The few times I did meet Harry Potter players in RL, and all the ones I've interacted with online..",2
it's truly rare that gaming communities are as friendly and nice as the WU one has been.,1
I never got my 5 Demiguise fragments to place the image and prestige that page to gold,0
Once I got past the frustration of that I focused on maxing my Auror profession which was easier than finding Demiguise,0
It was awesome doing Dark 5 a few more times with others on stream,1
"It was so much fun, and now that fun is over",1
😢,0
The only thing I didn't finish were adversaries,0
I only wanted to get them all to silver - they were just too tedious to try for more - but by the end I had given up on most of them because it was just impossible to get the fragments i needed,1
"The ones that defeated me and stayed on bronze were Pettigrew and his stupid rat, Lockhart and his dumb book, the Basilisk, and Narcissa and her terrible earrings.",2
"Awww, how bittersweet!",1
Oh I was ready to go that first night! I knew when sun down was,1
Had my head lamp set,0
"I had warned my husband, but he was still a bit concerned.

Muggle husband: So you're just going to wander around the neighborhood, in the dark, playing your Harry Potter game.

Me: you see they only come out at full moon because they're WEREWOLVES",2
"It'd be totally inaccurate if they were out during the day! 

Fast forward to a few nights ago and I caught my last werewolf while sitting at home.

Muggle husband: *hugs*🥺",1
That first werewolf night was fantastic!  So was trying to explain to people who were creeped out at “suspicious cars” in their neighborhood that there was a werewolf hunt!  😂,1
Muggles: can’t they do that during the day time?  Me:  Hunt werewolves during the day!?!  Definitely not,0
That makes no sense whatsoever!!  🌖,0
I am sorry you had a rough few days! Sending a virtual hug and hope things are better now,2
That’s pretty cool!  Hagrid always gave up the gold gifts exactly when the queue was clogged with the little energy gifts that nobody wanted,1
"Dang those were annoying, lol!",2
I hit 60 with a Hagrid,0
He was the first foundable and the last to max out.,1
I reset the time zone on my phone and got the next day‘s activities somehow,0
Does it help?  Nope 🙃,0
"Congrats, me, too!  Had been holding back since they said it would end, and wrapped it all up together",0
Just getting together and playing with other locals,2
"Met some really nice laid-back people, mixed generations, and shared a lot of laughs",1
That’s what the other games just haven’t offered and IDK yet how I will replace it,2
Probably won’t be through a game,2
"I wanted to do this too and I know I'm going to forget a ton of people -- but the ones whose gifts always gave me a lift (sometimes just because I loved your username) in the final days: HobbitDad, SyriusB, ShangelaLaquifa, Sixzileth, RascalHazard, RuthBeaterGnsbg (that one still makes me laugh), Penny Pharthing, Prospero Nelson, Malbus Mumblemor, Mathlete Law (I relate to your username), CorgiEsq, CeeAitch, 42RandomDent, the ever reliable KathyCPA, and my very first Reddit WU friend, Gigifaithlass, who was still sending wit potions until the very end",1
Thank you kind internet strangers.,1
Shroedinger’s exstimulo?,0
I didn't think about changing my time,0
I had thought it would go to the goodbye screen at midnight,0
"I now realize there were some screenshots I didn't take, but like the rest of the game, that will remain unfinished now.",2
Now I'm picturing an existential short story about the potion,0
"Does it still exist? Did they forget about it? Is it sad? Does it feel abandoned?

The potion wondered to itself ""Would anyone ever come to claim it? Had it been forgotten?""",2
Unaware the universe it existed in had ceased to be,0
"How then could it exist? Did it? The notification had brought to it, not an existence, but a being of sorts nonetheless, existing and not existing at the same time",0
Somewhere a cat inside a box could and could not feel very much for the potion's dilemma.,1
I think because of the timing this game had extra emotional resonance for a lot of people,2
"And so it really is a huge loss.

It's very much connected to the Before Times -- my husband and I played it at our kids' swim practices, on our vacation to Hawaii, on group camping trips, at dinners and events and outings, all things that it now feels like we will never do again (some of them we won't, because our kids grew up in the meantime)",1
"Then during the worst times of the pandemic -- the hard shutdown, the sudden loss of all human contact outside of our immediate family, the protests and police presence that shut down our city in the summer of 2020, the right wing protestors who made us feel unsafe outdoors for large parts of 2020 and 2021, the heavy smoke from wild fires in the western US -- the game and especially the Knight Bus were there",2
Very often walking the dog and playing the game was the only time my husband and I would leave the house for days,2
"When I needed a break from homeschooling kids and the claustrophobia and constant togetherness of 2020, I would take the game for a walk",2
The game connected the old life to the new reality,2
"Plus, our neighborhood has been hit very hard by the housing crisis and some of our old walking routes are now tent cities",2
"There is no garbage in the game, no human suffering, no real danger",2
Basically we've lost our little portal to a magical world,1
It's like Aslan telling Lucy she was too old to come back to Narnia,1
"I have been a little embarrassed by how sad I am, because I am honestly not that big a Harry Potter fan, but when I think about the game in the context of the pandemic and the dramatic ways that life has changed for the worse, it feels right to be sad",2
The real world isn't all that great right now.,1
Never got all the fragments to place my last missing foundable for one of the dragon adversaries (don’t remember which one anymore - edit: missing two fragments of the egg-looking thing on the Ancient Hungarian Horntail page per my screenshot),2
EDMs never got me the right one,1
"Never figured out what to do to find Madam Hooch, the nimbus 3000 or the goblet of fire, all of which I needed to prestige to gold.",0
He was my last feared adversary to get to silver,0
It took forever to get the fingers I needed,2
RNG can be so unforgiving.,0
Oh dang!,0
Love this way of looking at it!,1
"Niantic, on-brand to the very end",1
I had a bunch of portkeys I was going to open today as my final farewell,0
"Had a good ride though, even if I only made it to Level 46.",1
That’s great,1
"I was thinking that as I was driving around today… like we got to peek in on the wizarding world around us, and now we know it’s there.",0
It let you keep logging on until midnight in your local time zone,0
"If you were on though, it let most people keep playing until you had a glitch or needed to restart",1
I played for an additional hour or so before I shut it off myself,0
"You could change your time zone to keep being able to log in as well, but now the servers are fully shut down",1
"Haha, considering they couldn't even fix most of the bugs in the game, I doubt they would be smart enough to code it like that",1
Increased play time towards the end of the game probably didn't matter to them since there was no way to for anyone to spend money in the game any more,2
"But, who knows? I was grinding and playing like crazy anyway trying to get to level 60, which I did with 24 minutes to spare",2
:3,0
"I’m really sad, too",2
It meant a lot to be part of that world.,1
And you could lean out of the window...,0
I’m having big grief feelings today too,0
I kind of stopped playing often when they said they were shutting down,1
You get to share your story,0
You get to be sad.,2
your profession,0
All my feared adversaries made it to silver except for Peter Pettigrew - came up 3 Scabbers short.,0
Hey there friend!  Thanks for posting this,1
I feel kind of empty…,1
"Yeah, I switched timezones and dates as well to play a bit longer! But now I can't login anymore",0
This hurts me!,0
I needed four Aragog egg fragments to prestige to bronze when they annouced the closing of HPWU,0
"I never got any of them :')

(But, did manage a \*lot\* of other stuff, including lvl 60, gold on all the normal registry pages, etc, etc)",2
"I was one fragment away (and exactly one fragment away) from getting stars in every 1920's gold frame in ALL THREE frames.

(I basically needed 3 fragments - 1 each frame to super complete)",1
I would have grinded the fortresses more before they were nerfed,1
I finished about 200 red spell books shy of maxing out all 3 professions.,2
"Such a good idea waving hands in game to say bye bye, sad I didn't think to do it before game ending :')",2
"Same! Left the game for 3 months but still reading Reddit to see how all was going.

I came back when closure was announced and I got known about this thanks to the pinned post here 

Best wishes from Spain!",1
"That picture is absolutely hilarious - I‘m permitted to state that, as my real name is Sybil(le)",1
"If you live in an area with many gyms, you can easily get enough coins to expand your storage in as little as 4 days.",1
Failure or part of their design knowing that people who have to complete everything would increase their play time in hopes of getting the rare items?,1
Mine is the first time the dragons appeared the game for those of us who did not go to Indianapolis,2
I was amazed at how cool they looked and moved,1
I miss this game so much already!,2
So glad I got those 2 useless Brain Elixirs after no longer needing XP,2
😂,0
I also had things spawning so I left the game open and went to sleep,2
Woke to the finish screen,0
"Initially I didn't want to play this game, but an ex bf convinced me to play with him",2
Our 9 year relationship ended but I still played,0
Now I feel like there is one less thing tying me to that time,2
😕,0
"No matter how long and hard I played, RNG chose not to grace me with these last couple of things I wanted to get.

What did you miss out on getting?",2
"Darn, ok, thanks for taking this video!!",1
Same here.i thought I had until midnight Jan 31,0
I guess I should have clued in when people in the other hemisphere were saying their goodbyes at  noon...,2
I'm not sure but you can save the reddit post to find it later,2
💔,0
Always.,0
Super cute!,1
Do you know how I can save this video to my camera roll? I meant to screen record all the pages but I thought we had 1 more day to play 😭,1
That would have been awesome,1
"I wouldn't have been good at finding things in the books but I would bet wife would know which book to go to and a section of 20 pages that had the answer.

Since they included much more in this game than the movies did, I had to constantly ask her what the story was about certain things (ex",1
blast-ended skrewt),0
Thank you for making this!! I wanted to screen record the whole registry but didn’t realize the game would end on the 30th instead of 31st 😭,2
"I took screenshots of every page in the game, but there are a few early brilliant pages I didn't finish because I didn't really understand the game at the time.",2
I just realized blue wasn't the default color for the avatar lol,1
Does it change with your house?,0
"I was recording at midnight EST and was confused for a sec why it kept playing until I remembered time zones, lol",1
"When it glitched when opening the task list and I had to restart, I got this page.",0
What a wonderful final post,1
I loved this game,2
I wish the story had us pulling out our harry potter books and looking up clues to solve it,0
I understand it was a get out and meet your community type of game but this community has a lot of die hard potter fans who are very knowledgeable in the stories,2
It would have been amazing if they did something like that,1
The chatter the reddit threads would have would have entertained me immensely.,1
the said to all by the middle of the month.,0
not 3 days before closing.,0
relaxxxx,0
"Just tried this, can't hurt to ask.",0
That's why I did a screen record,0
"Took about 10 minutes to scroll through all of the registry pages, achievements, skill trees, etc., but is a nice keepsake of accomplishments for the game",2
"I also turned the music on for the first time since day 1, and that's saved too.",1
I thought the same thing!,0
"I did screenshots of all of my progress, then got to the brilliant pages and thought ""nevermind, that'll take way too long"".",1
I went out doing Dark V on my own for the first time! What a rush!,1
I needed blue books,0
Desperately,2
Didn't finish my tree,0
"*sigh*

Edited to add: I know that I just needed to grind to earn them, but I'm old and work full time",1
LOL,1
😫 That hurts,0
I originally thought the same but hopped on here just to check things out and saw the other side of the world already saying their goodbyes with the Thank You screen of doom,2
So what was already a long day became even longer,2
"I had one more goal and in the end came super close to achieving it but didn't, the game glitched with my last portkeys after 12 and when I went back gone.",1
I took so many screenshots too,1
lol I'm only missing one thing from the Brilliant Forbidden Forest II page,1
Only Brilliant event I didn't 100% finish because I missed that they had shortened it from a week to 4 days and thought I had more time,1
;_:,0
I just opened the app out of habit without even thinking and got all sad,2
I got it last night! Woo hoo!,0
no,0
you don’t need your own post.,1
I am pleased to drive around and know that the magical world still has portals to Inns and Greenhouses and Fortresses,1
I am glad I got a glimpse of it all!,1
Day 1 here too,0
Will miss it.,0
I was just organizing a bookshelf when I found a picture flip book my family made at the WU event in Indianapolis,0
We were so happy,1
Dang it,0
I’m not crying! You’re crying!,2
I did at the time and just got the mail loading screen with the bar at the bottom not moving😕,0
Wands up,0
"Yeah, I'm pretty bummed out",1
I played it hard when it came out until a couple weeks ago when my passion finally ran out,2
Ah well.,0
"Ah, thought it would be shut down after today",2
Ah well.,0
I never noticed CIRCUS CALAMITOUS didn’t have BRILLIANT EVENT in the title.,1
I love that,1
I kept thinking “i could just grab some coffee… I took tomorrow off for this anyway.” I rationalized myself out of it,0
"Did everything one more time, took a good look around, and said goodbye.",1
Anyone else still annoyed by the one page missing Brilliant Event from the page title?,2
Wow,1
Great job.,1
Right?!!?  I got a notification that multiple portkeys are ready 😢😢😢😢,1
Damn I also loved doing Dark V on quarantine when it was easy to get energy,1
"After the bonuses were cut, I stopped and I actually lacked red books more than anything",1
"But it was really fun! We had a chat where we coordinated, then we made another, I even went on Discord and fought with someone",1
"I participated in some streams trying to fight with a streamer and I think I had some of their friends and we fought together.

That said, I deleted the game several months ago and only redownloaded yesterday to say bye.

I never lost hope that one day they fix everything",2
That I will hear from my friends who were still playing that it's now easy to make a custom party for D5 and play with your friends,1
That they fixed bugs and such,1
That it will be once again easy to get energy for it,1
We were losing an hour sometimes just to find each other,2
Our communities just feel so fleeting now,0
It all was changing really fast,1
I guess frustration is the word? This game could have been so much more.,1
That's wonderful,1
Thanks for making this :),1
I'm already a level 42 pokémon go player,0
"I did download pikmin bloom, but it didnt catch my interest, so it's deleted already.",0
The announcement did says 12.01am on the 31st...not really their fault this time.,2
They've probably turned it off now given that everywhere has already passed finishing time,0
Changing the date probably only worked while it was still the 30th somewhere in the world.,0
If you change the date and after asking that you change again to correct date the process should complete and you should access again to the game,2
"Oh wow, yea you sent great stuff too! Thanks for the good times!",1
Managed to stay in and play for another hour was even sadder picking up the last gift for January and seeing it say to return tomorrow for another gift.,0
"The ""Come back in ..."" message taunts us.",0
Same also really sad HPWU helped get me mentally through the last two years.,2
"As mad as the game has gotten me over the last year or so, I woke up thinking I still had today to close it out",2
I was so sad to see it shut down already this morning.,2
I have so many memories playing this game I don't know where to start,2
"Never missed a day since it launched, and even though I slowed down in the last months after it was announced to be closing I still played while I ran almost every morning, collecting what I was short of.


I even paid for internet on a cruise so I could continue playing while sailing in the middle of the ocean",2
"Nothing to catch though, except what came out from potions.



Now I feel like I have nothing to do while running or just walking around in general, and it's a strange gap in my life for now",1
I absolutely get this,1
"I'll miss it terribly, too",2
Played until 16.10 when it finally crashed and threw me out of the game twenty minutes ago,2
"Don't even know why I kept going, because I was afraid to click half the buttons for fear of getting knocked out and locked out, so I hadn't checked my registry, and yet I kept going",2
Bought 20k energy and 100 EDMs this morning and was merrily using them until it barfed mid TTD,2
"Not even sure what those extra couple of hours got me, and yet if it hadn't crashed, I know I'd still be playing",1
"On the upside, I guess I can get some sleep and actually use my phone again..",0
(This is not a consolation.),0
Tried it (changed phone date to January 29th) and the game came up to the login process asking for my birthdate and account and then didn't launch for me,2
Android user here so maybe iOS people might have better luck until they actually turn the servers off.,1
This makes me so happy! I wondered if my last-minute friending made a difference to anyone,1
Glad you made it 🤗,1
"Eyy congrats! 
I stopped playing a while ago bc I was busy, but my username was FerskKoriander",1
"I remember you consistently sent awesome gifts, over a looong time period",1
"Really stood out on my friend list, so thanks for that!!!",1
I get it,0
So many memories,1
Yesterday new ones were popping up randomly as I played,2
"It's been what, two and a half years, so I guess you collect them.

I remember the moment of discovery that every overlook on the blue ridge parkway was either an inn or a fortress (long before the night bus)",2
So any trip my husband and I took to the mountains was filled with battles and swearing when my phone borked due to lack of service,1
I did two community days as meet-ups,0
"I had so much fun the first one I FORGOT to collect the final reward after I finished! It was just so much fun getting to play with other people and strategize - wasn't good at battles yet, so I learned a lot from better players.

There's just so much to unpack",1
I miss it already,0
I still don't believe it's gone,0
"I played until 12:15, and I had to make myself exit the game",2
I just couldn't stay up,0
But it broke my heart to exit that last time,0
It broke my heart.,0
Yup..,0
it will take some getting used to.,0
"Yeah, I came on here last week to check about the ending date",0
"I'm sorry you didn't get to enjoy a last lap.
Feels surreal",1
"I'm passing places, and thinking, oh, there goes a  Greenhouse..",0
or an Inn...,0
😭,0
Opened up the app today to find the same message ☹️ used to log in every day,0
"That's such a great way to go out, happy for you that you had one last bit of community!",1
I feel this statement as if you said the words for me,0
I’m a nurse and work toooooo fucking much but I’ve played this game since day 1 and it was my distraction from the stressful days,2
"I played every day, some only for a short bit and some days for hours but it was my reliable counselor lol 😂 I really loved this game and hated it at the same time",2
"But you can’t hate something without love right? I’m not a game player either, this was literally the only game I’ve ever ritually played",2
I’m heartbroken as I thought today was the last day to play and felt the gut wrenching stab in the chest when I opened it this morning and found it was over already,0
Either way I’m grateful for having this game for the last few years and for the community it lead me to that I’d have never know otherwise,2
Thank you for posting this… literally took the words from my mouth exactly how I feel right now.,1
"I just got a notification that my potion finished brewing, Lol!  Can’t log in, though",1
"I was still playing at like 12:30 am my time - things were still spawning, including lethal adversaries, and I decided to close it and try to go back in, just to see what would happen",2
I wish I hadn't and that I had just played it for as long as I could,2
"I wish I would have had the patience to take pictures of every single foundable's little info page when you click on it, but I was trying to screenshot all of my pages and my titles and my badges and I kept worrying it was just going to kick me out.

I'm sad that it's gone both because I played it with my fiancee and because I definitely had times where I paid more attention to it than I did PoGo",2
It sucks to lose something that we both enjoyed doing together so much.,1
Agreed- the extras made it MUCH more fun!  The game just wasn’t rewarding enough and probably would have fared much better if it was more like this all along,1
I've already deleted it,0
But it felt like I was deleting a friend,0
I already miss playing,0
I was 2/3 of the way through level 59 and was 30 red books short of finishing all 3 professions,0
"I tried to push through over the last month and did good, just fell a tad short",1
It was a good run and could have been a better game had they put a good team on it.,1
Yes!!!!,0
I thought today was the last day to play,0
I’m so sad,2
I feel robbed!,0
"I was able to keep playing past midnight, and sent you one last xp gift",1
I got a little emotional seeing this post,2
Thank you for sharing!,0
That is a truly awesome pic!,1
Viva la Resistance!   Blue is better!  😎,1
And the original announcement stated until Feb 1st,1
That's because at the daily rewards page the last day of January was listed with energy bolts.,0
lol.,1
that actually works :D,0
"Eh, played pogo before hpwu, I just hate the storage issues, which was a big draw of hpwu for me",2
"I will go back to it, and possibly even ingress, but they're just not as fun.",1
"Yeah, it was so confusing b/c it seems intuitive that they game would go through the end of the month.",2
"Same here, not surprising that they messed up the end of the game just like the rest of their fuck ups",2
🤦‍♀️,0
Yes I did change my phone time to Honolulu time (I am on the east coast),0
I watched the live endings on a couple of youtube channels and played to around 2:30 am my time (eastern),1
I was gifting gold gifts as fast as I was getting them,1
I even added about 6 people as friends from the youtube chats,0
Its sad that I had the most fun on the bus on the last day,1
I think everyone on the bus was seasoned players...,1
I never encountered any players who sat there and did nothing for once,0
Real Players and Potions where flying.,1
"I had fun.

I fell asleep with my phone on..",1
when i woke up about 4 hours later I had the ending message,0
On a positive note..,1
I deleted it completely off my phone and now it's working so much faster.,1
I would have attempted to play more frequently,1
I am more of a console/PC gamer as I have learned over the years so I tend to play mobile games/apps very sporadically,1
I feel that I missed out on a lot by not playing regularly,0
I am one who began playing daily at or nearly at the beginning of the game's run but then teetered off,2
"I thought that it was great but was too lazy and ""busy"" to walk even 15 minutes while playing daily",1
It would have kept me in the game more and I probably would not have put on so much weight during the pandemic so far since I was more physically active while playing regularly,1
I particularly enjoyed playing while jogging which I found out was possible a few months ago.,1
I’m so sad now,2
Are y’all going to delete the app of your phone now?,0
I thought we had 1 more day too,1
Oh well,1
"I found this game to be more tedious than fun , other than the last few weeks with all the extra bonuses.",2
Oh I wish I had done this! And thanks for posting so I can pretend!,1
If you want a new existing player friend with more time to grind to 50 now that we are down a game: 6099 4199 9008,2
Damn I realized that I don't remember my last encounter,0
"But I encountered that flying thing from dark arts and Hagrid, and both fled, just like at my first days.",2
Thank you for doing this!,0
"Apparently if you change your phone’s date, you’ll be able to get back in (at least for now - who knows when they’re turning things off server-side).",1
Same,0
"I was okay with it ending, but played to the end and thought that was through today",1
Would have liked to know it was the last time I was playing,1
Guess I misread “as of the 31st” as through the 31st,0
Glad to know I wasn’t the only one who did this saved gifts from New Orleans (last vacation before Covid) and Iceland,1
At least PoGo has scrapbook so you can save certain gifts without having to just leave them in inventory,1
I did more Dark V chambers tonight than I did all of last month,1
Early in the evening I played Magizoologist because it seemed to be the profession most in need,1
"I also had never soloed Dark V as a Magoo, so I wanted to get that informal achievement out of the way.

As I got on towards midnight, I started grinding out Dark V",2
"I had at least one group of five, but I did several two person teams as well",2
"Anyone I could find who wanted to go in could have a team mate in me.

Midnight came and I still was not kicked out, so I kept on, chamber after chamber",0
By 12:45 I couldn’t find team mates so I clicked my avatar to wave goodbye and went to make sure I didn’t miss unlocking any portrait modifications,1
"I didn’t, but the game crashed once it showed me the last screen.

I guess I went out the way I wanted, Dark V and a final look around",2
"The program did too, it was generous with time and letting  me do what I wanted, and then went out with a crash.",0
Ah well.,0
"You’re not the only one 😢
I had 1 more achievement and was going to record me going around the whole game",1
Just opened the game up and felt my heart drop to my stomach,2
"i’d love to know just how much time i spent in this game too, but at the same time i’m already embarrassed thinking about it haha",2
i loved the one guy that looked like Paul Rudd (i think others on here mentioned it too when it first appeared around dec 2020 lol),1
"i love this! i always liked looking at the ones i had especially living in Las Vegas, many of them on Fremont and the strip can be cool as hell",1
i always made sure to save the special ones for the people i regularly sent and received from,1
i hope they enjoyed seeing them as much as i did 🥺,1
"Did you manage to do this? I did it and played briefly, giving away all my gold gifts too, but it was super late where I was and the last place on earth was offline as well when I woke up :(",2
i was just thinking about this today and was going to search in here about it,0
i forgot about it until now.,0
"Thanks! I did this and played a bit for the last time then went to sleep, woke up and even the last time zone on earth is offline now :(",1
you worded it perfectly,1
only 2 of my few friends know how much i love playing even tho they thought it was silly,2
"it never failed when i’d be out with either of them, they’d ask where i was wandering off to and then say, “oh, you’re playing your game..” and laugh.",2
same,0
i learned so much info from here during the pandemic when i started playing in 2020,1
"i probably would have given up and been so lost if it wasn’t for this group!
i’ll miss it all so much",1

Goodbye from California! I'm so sad...,2
Try changing timezone if you want,0
i’ll miss the gorgeous visuals,1
"the artists who worked on this were amazing! 😫

my game just stopped working… :/

https://youtu.be/On9AOg5urFc",2
And at 21 past midnight the game stopped working RIGHT when my last portkeys unlocked thus me not getting gold on the last page of the 1920s like I said I wouldn't,2
I just needed 2 more and opened I think 40-50 ports since I first posted,1
😕,0
I checked the FAQ,0
There isn’t a link to help with HPWU withdrawals,0
"Ya know, something like ‘Ask your doctor if Niantic is right for you’.",1
"I keep gifts from significant moments, intending to never send them out",1
"When I heard the game was ending, I took this screen recording and started either giving them away or deleting them",2
"If you got one of them, I hope you enjoyed them as much as I enjoyed looking back at them.

"The game may no longer be with us, but now, I have shared what it meant to me",2
Thank you for reading.,0
Right back at ya,1
Yep,0
Most of mine are silver.I did at least get all the lethal to gold,2
I had a hard time getting enough encounters over the past month or two.,2
This Londoner is not quite ready to let go yet and may have changed her time zone to Samoa ;),2
Ugh I feel so teary,0
I can't explain this to my partner who doesn't play mobile games,0
And I didn't know anyone else IRL who played this game.,2
I'm so sad,2
"Goodbye! And thank you, HPWU team!",0
"That nag screen is based on local device time, so if you clock it back, you'll be able to sign in",1
"At least until 31st happens worldwide, I think.",2
I was just in the middle of a brain elixir when it crashed,0
I got an extra 30 mins or so past midnight here in the US,2
I didn't know it was ending at midnight,0
"When I reopened the game, I got the farewell message",2
Thought I had one more day.,1
In one of the brilliant events they had all four common rooms,1
Hufflepuff was so pretty so I had to save it,1
Now I wish I have a video of the astronomy tower portkey as well…,0
This was from one of the brilliant events,1
They had all four common rooms,2
Hufflepuff was the prettiest by far!,1
Haha I saw that too! But nothing is impossible at Hogwarts!,2
I should also say that Pikmin Bloom exists,0
Yeah it can go the same route as HPWU and Catan but it's really casual and is more of a fitness app than anything.,1
Exactly what happened to me,1
:(,0
I stopped picking up portkeys when they started giving fragments as rewards but I accidentally picked one of these up while trying pick something else up,0
I was annoyed but when I opened it I was so glad I had!!,1
Here’s a pogo referral code if you need it,0
Gives us both rewards for playing,0
WPK4HM4XK,0
I thought we'd get to the end of Jan 31st,0
"I guess I don't get one last afternoon of play.

Anyway, thanks Niantic & the HPWU team for a few years of fun",1
Woo! Prestige!! I just prestige’d my dragon egg pages—finally!!,0
So long enjoy what life gives to you,1
Congratulations!,0
"Most: 3 headed dog (458)
Least: Pickett (28)",1
👏👏👏 congrats! So glad you were able to pull 60 out!,1
"This weekend was really fun!  Free bonus in the store, keys in the map",1
Lots and lots of portkeys only 1 km for most,1
And dragons everywhere!  Many thanks for those bonuses,1
Will miss the game.,2
"Least: Goblet of Fire… a whopping 35, and I started pretty near day 1… Followed by Demiguise at 87",2
"Both pages definitely won't be getting to Gold in half an hour! Well, not both completely least, but the most annoying as they've kept me from gold…
Many of the baby Creatures were under 60, but at least they went Gold! Young James, actually least, has been seen 31, but he started popping up when needed, and now it's Peter and Sirius holding that page back… sigh…",2
I still remember the first day,1
I literally ran into 2 rando guys (or I should say we ran into each other) on the sidewalk the evening of the release,2
We laughed because we realized we all were playing HPWU and were in “the zone”,1
We hung out for a bit and figured out the trick to the potions and then went our separate ways,0
I’ve played every day since,0
Take care and I bet you’ll always think of HPWU on your son’s birthday! 🎂😂,0
"No kidding :P I'm very much a night person, and the only reason I even hit Bronze on that page was the one Saturday event they were all over for a day",1
"Insomnia days or those random I had to wake up way too early I tried, but still only managed 17/25 on the Bronze page, while I've placed dozens of Horned Serpents :P",2
Congratulations!!! Great way to go out!,1
I must have read your mind! 😂,0
You are welcome!  Many good memories!,1
"As I managed to *finally* get my last couple Mirrors at a bit past 11pm, which allowed me to finally prestige that page to gold after forever— I can stop being bitter and notice that this actually makes sense!",2
I get it,0
I have so many videos! I’ll be in withdrawal the next couple of days,1
Take care!,0
You too! It’s been fun!,1
Cheers to you as well!,0
No,0
I found a spreadsheet to download in an old post and used that to enter my numbers manually.,1
"I wouldn't have sat at a cell phone store for an hour+ so many nights doing battles knowing the knights bus would come and I could battle later.

It was worth doing back then because sponsored locations gave more XP, but also realizing with hindsight I'd never run out of runestones I could have just waited and ran way more stones from the comfort of my house.",1
Nice! My goal was to get Wands I to gold,1
I got the last fragment I needed at 11:57,0
Just had to solo Dark V quite a few times.,2
Did you request your data to get this info? I didn’t do that and now wish I had,0
:(,0
"Though, it did kinda big me that the rays of light coming there the windows are off...",1
That room literally stopped me in my tracks (I was walking my dog when I opened the first one),1
It was such a peaceful room with all the plants and light coming in the stained glass windows,1
The books and fireplace and cozy places to sit,1
❤️,0
Sending you a friend request! I can send you XP,0
I only need XP.,0
"I have Hagrid ready to place at 11:59, as well.",1
This actually makes a lot of sense,1
Why would it wish for a girl troll on her own otherwise?,1
"(First, thanks to u/kjgooster for the inspiration to have my little friend wave goodbye!)

Echoing all that's been said already today - Day 1 player, hit 60 a while ago but still played every day",1
"I don't know anyone else IRL who plays, so this community was a huge part of what made all the magic of the game feel real",1
"It's probably one of the only parts of my daily routine that stayed (more or less) stable throughout the pandemic, and in a weird way it was comforting to ""know"" and ""be with"" people around the world, all of us in a familiar space during a confusing time.

I was only an occasional contributor here but I read everything, and was so grateful to all those who posted event summaries, monthly event dates, and tips & tricks for new features (I'll never forget poring over charts for optimal team play when the Knight Bus came out!)",1
THANK YOU endlessly to everyone here! Cheers!,0
"As the Vision said ""what is grief, if not love perservering."" I hope you find another game or hobby to bring you joy",1
Wizards Unite and Pokemon Go have always felt a bit like birding to me,0
You go out and explore for whatever you can find,0
You might try iNaturalist and make a game out of observing local wildlife,2
Best of luck to you.,1
Same!,0
"Same, thanks for all the fun over last few years",1
I wouldn’t have stopped playing for whole year,1
I was a daily player until I was very sick with pregnancy complications and then with a newborn,2
Only picked it up again the last few months and barely squeaked level 60 out tonight,2
I would have used my runes and potions and keys instead of hoarding them! And I would have spent all the scrolls end books before this week too.,2
Thanks for this idea,1
Gonna screen record and  tap on my player too and have her wave goodbye or yoohoo,0
Right?!? Same thought,1
Come on … I looooove getting trace charms and was hoping to drop em like crazy but lack of keys rewards and such im calling it,2
I will miss this game.,2
"I'm sorry I never saw this one, but I stopped opening brilliant portkeys when it became unnecessary with the bonus tasks.",2
"Least: Baby Chinese Fireball, 88
Most: Three-headed Dog, 1704",1
I keep getting those these last few days.,2
I am feeling the same,0
Just closed out for the last time,2
"Finished with Hagrid as my last foundable, and actually played full dark chambers on the knight bus the past few days",2
I will miss this game but it was a good way to go out.,1
"I saved one of these portkeys until today, so this would be the last place I visited inworld",0
"I live on a sailboat, and somehow this really made it seem like maybe I could do what the Durmstrang boat did, and show up for a visit...",1
It's not at all silly to grieve it,2
"This was, essentially, a place we all came to live in, through a pandemic",1
"It provided breadth to our lockdown points of view, and it provided connection to people across the world",0
"I am so, so sorry they made the decision they made to end it",2
I'll miss you all too.,0
"Ah, yes, that reminds me I was thinking of doing Dark chambers - my highest is Dark II; maybe I could get through the rest",2
Less than six hours left to decide.,2
Take care!,0
Shoot! I didn’t do the brilliant portkeys since the pandemic changed things and they weren’t necessary,1
Now I’m bummed at what I might have missed!,0
"I always had the sound off, too (it would have made me crazy) but I did turn it on for the past couple of weeks to see what it was like, and there is definitely some fun stuff there",2
"My plans for the last day were to play a couple of hours longer than usual, and to use up all my silver keys",2
"I ended up levelling up and was mildly annoyed to have earned another silver key, but fortunately I had the time to pick up and walk off another portkey",2
I didn't want to set any lofty goals,0
I just wanted to relax and enjoy the game for the last time,1
I did end up prestiging four pages incidentally,0
"Oh, and I planted at the local greenhouses to light them up",1
"Then, at midnight, I'm going to have the game open so I can be there at the end.",2
Same,0
Just claimed amd got shut out,0
I feel sad :(,2
I was think about this one today!,0
Same here! Thanks for saying it 😊,1
Take care!,0
"It's been fun, hit Lvl 60 a couple days ago, defeated Voldemort one last time, and I'm out!",1
Take care!,0
Haha,1
Yeah,0
For the past 2 years I've done laps around the inside of my house for 40 minutes first thing in the morning,2
Not sure what I'm going to do going forward to keep motivated to exercise,2
"Maybe return to Pokemon Go, but not as obsessively.",0
Thank you for sharing this! Sweet memories…,1
Take care!,0
I love this location!,1
If you didn’t close the game you can still play after 12 am… but I don’t know for how long,2
"Over in Spain, too.
Thank you for your help!",0
