He never denied Adonis once,0
That is a false narrative that people are parroting online,2
People simply didn't know about Adonis until Pusha T revealed him,0
"Drake didn't deny Adonis' existence at any point after he was revealed.

If you're interested in more background, I'll type a bit: at the time of Pusha T's diss he was still doing testing to make sure the kid was actually his and didn't fully confirm it until shortly before Scorpion was released",1
"At which point he pretty quickly made songs about Adonis.

Think about it: why would he be planning an Adidas press release around his son if he wasn't going to tell the world about it? Pusha T's 2 separate claims conflict with one another: that Drake was both trying to hide his kid from the world but that he also was trying to base an Adidas launch around revealing his son.

As it turns out neither of those are fully correct, but whatever.


By the way, What's Kendrick's son's name? Or do we not know because people are allowed to keep their children private when they aren't Drake?",1
