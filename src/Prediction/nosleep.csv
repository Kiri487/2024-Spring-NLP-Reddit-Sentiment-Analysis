And before all that happens he'll still have many options to find a different way to get her to leave him alone.",1
"Ohhh that makes sense

She didn't make the deal with you because she wanted his skin, but to get him away from people.

I think you're lucky because she could've also gotten him to isolate by hurting you instead.

The skin contract maybe also served the purpose of getting rid of the other paranormal entity Jack had a deal with, based on back when the lady in red saved his life in the nursery home I'd assume she really doesn't want him to die.

It's been six months since then and Jack has posted nothing during that time, did she just fuck off for half a year? I don't understand her actions",1

I still don't understand why she does the things she does but at the same time she's not a mammal so probably also doesn't think like one",2
"So, wait, did your family see shit before? And this fear thing? You knew about it already? How did you know what it was? Or was it just a feeling you got that was more than normal fear?

Something's fishy here,0
"Just like you've said, money can make people blind, and judging by how many people here think that you've missed a great opportunity to earn a lot by doing mostly nothing and ignoring the crying, you're completely right",1
But I really do think you've accidentally done the right thing,1
"Because if we ignore the money, the situation looks bizarre",1
"Why all of the rules focus on keeping everything locked and ignoring the standard means of communication for ghosts (mirrors)? 

If Ms",0
"Ferguson was always living alone, who else would be crying in the walls if not her? 

If this is all about ""caring for the forgotten and cherishing them"", why was her only wish not fulfilled? 

My theory is that this supernatural businessman had sold the ""cherished after death"" dream to her, under the condition of his agency being in her will",2
Then he trapped the poor woman after she died,2
"He got all her money, her estate and her soul",0
"By breaking the rules, you've let her out",0
"And since she didn't have anyone else, she attaches herself to you, in hopes of finding peace",0
I'm sorry you've had to cancel your wedding,2
I'm sorry you've lost the opportunity to earn enough money to live a comfortable life,1
"But maybe the thought that you've saved an unfortunate soul from a scumbag, who preys on lonely and vulnerable, will be enough comfort for you",2
"You can't take money into the afterlife, after all.",0

I don‚Äôt know,0
"I tried to ask my friend where he‚Äôd been a little after this, but all I could get out of him in terms of an answer was ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù so I‚Äôve just kinda let him be for tonight",2

What was Damien playing at? What was he getting out of the deal?",1
Well if the wife outside is the real deal she will surely get the hidden key and come in,1
In fact I‚Äôm surprised she didn‚Äôt do that to begin with,1
The fact she walked off and hasn‚Äôt come back with the key indicates to me outdoor wife is a bit abnormal in her reaction to the predicament she‚Äôs found herself in,2
Abnormal enough to suggest she has some gaps in her knowledge,2

He had history when it came to disruptive behaviour,0
"As Jennet said, whenever debates became too heated, things took a frightening turn",2
That‚Äôs why I steered the conversation away from anything personal,0
It was for Alex‚Äôs sake,0
I would‚Äôve been a poor professor if I‚Äôd allowed things to get too ugly,2

"Emma, you might be able to defeat the Lady",1
Just make damned sure you don't get into even worse trouble to do so,2
Or become an entity yourself.,0
">¬†I feel like you still learned a lot from Jack!

We really balanced each other..",1
I don't think I realized how much until he was gone,1
"Like as imperfect a person as he is, he for sure made me \*better\* than I was",1
I miss who I was with him almost as much as I miss him,1
If that makes sense.,0
">And I totally agree that Emma is definitely the one that can take down the Lady.

Thank you! I'm working on it! It's difficult because a lot of these demonology books insist on the importance of knowing her name",2
Which I don't,0
But I'm not giving up!,0
">And honestly, if anyone was going to take her down I fully believe it'd be you",1
"You've got that vibe.

Thanks! I've been doing a lot of research and I have some ideas",1
I just need him to reach out to me..,0
It's been weeks since he disappeared,0
"I just didn't write about it until now because, honestly, I thought he'd reach out",1
This post is kinda my cry into the void for him to please please contact me,0
I don't even know if he's alive or dead,2
"You're right, I should look for weird stuff",2
That might be the only way I'll cross paths with him.,0
It seems strange to me that you created a situation of ‚Äúteaching‚Äù logical and illogical arguments but drew the line at ad hominem arguments,1
"Illogical arguments themselves are a result of a logical fallacy, so why did you pick a specific one to take issue with? Further, you said that debates are often settled based on unfounded beliefs and ad hominem attacks can be part of that",1
"Instead of chiding a student you didn‚Äôt like, you could have taken the time to point out that this was the entire point you were making",0
"Even Mason‚Äôs annoyance could be seen by some, based on your premise of emotions playing a role in decisions, as his dedication to his beliefs",0
I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you,2
I truly am,0
But you were a poor professor.,2
"Maybe it's wishful thinking on my part, but I don't think he meant what he said",0
I think it was a trauma response,0
"Like if he'd been in his right mind and not having a full blown panic attack, I don't think he'd have said it",1
Also he saved my grandmother's life once,0
"So when I beat his demon and free him from her, I'll have returned the favor.",1
Run!,0
Jack and weird stuff go together like peanut butter and jelly! And I totally agree that Emma is definitely the one that can take down the Lady.,2
"Even if it was just a brief fling -- I feel like you still learned a lot from Jack!

But I'd maybe stay away..",1
