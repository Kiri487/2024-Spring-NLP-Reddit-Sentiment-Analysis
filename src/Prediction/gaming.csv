"> The entire premise of the game is that each number correlates to that many number of mines in the surrounding 8 blocks around each number.

Yes.

> If there is no number in the adjacent blocks because you already know all 8 blocks are mines then it is literally impossible for the centre block to be a mine.

...no",2
That does not follow,0
A number tells you how many mines are around it,1
That does not mean that every mine must have a number around it.,1
As someone who grew up with arcades I think despite seeming similar they are very different,0
Arcades were a very social thing,1
You would go to one and meet other kids and make friends,2
You would watch other people play and cheer them on,2
You would see that one kid who was amazing at game x and everyone gather round to see if they break the high score today,1
"Even if you were not being social, you were still out the house doing something and there was also a limit",1
"Arcades would also close for the day and on some days you might not be able to get there.

Mobile phone games are designed around staring at a small screen, with no limit, it never closes and the entire game is mostly just a solitary thing that's designed around dopamine addiction to get you to spend money, Which I know arcades were to but there was more to it than that.

Not to mention when arcades were a thing gaming in general was quite limited",1
$60 would get you a shit game that has about 2 mins of actual content whereas now you have 1000s of games you can get for super cheap with 100s of hours of content,1
Before your gaming choices were something kind of bad at home or going to an arcade,2
But now you can piss money away on a bad mobile phone game or spend like $10 to get a game with a 100 hours content.,2
"If you use slow time, that achievement can be surprisingly easy to get",1
I think the achievement counts in game time instead of real play time.,2
Faster Than Light (FTL) is still a recommended game if you enjoy space games with a touch of rogue lite,1
I've been playing it for years and years but I never seem to get bored of it,2
Should be dirt cheap as well.,1
Just sad what the gaming industry is now.,2
"Pablo is indeed a unique character, and we are exploring his future in the story",1

"I dont know what can you do to get 80% CPU usage (i5-12400F) and 62% GPU (3060) as ""general task"" thats not a game or blender ig

"Just a heads up, bottleneck calculators are notoriously inaccurate",2
Do not take their advice at face value,0
You are far better off looking at actual gaming benchmarks to gauge performance,1
I fell into the same trap in the past,2
"Just have a Google if you're still skeptical.

The 3900 is still usable for modern games paired with a modern GPU at 1440p",1
"I just had a look at a benchmark using a 4080 with a 3900x, 5900x, 7800x3d and the difference between the three isnt significant in the sense they're all producing high enough fps numbers ( >100 with a 10-25% difference at most)",1
"I'd suggest you look at games you want to play and see how your old CPU performs.

The GPU upgrade will make the most difference for you without a doubt",1
You can always pick up a 5800x3d later if you so wish.,0

There's an insurance mechanic in the game,2
"So if your ship explodes or gets stolen or things just get wonky with it, you can go to one of the ship spawning terminals and put in an insurance claim",0
"Once you do that, you'll have to wait a certain amount of time to be able to actually spawn in your ship (usually a handful of minutes)",1
"You will also have the option to pay to expedite the claim, which means you have to wait a significantly less amount of time",2
"Most starter ships have pretty quick claim times, so you won't be grounded for long.

Right now, these insurance claims are free but at some point in the future you can expect to pay a fee to have the ships insured",1
"There's no info on exactly how this will work at this point in time, but you will see that when you buy a ship with real world cash there will be something like 6 month insurance, 120 month insurance, or LTI (life time insurance) attached to the ship details",1
That means you'll be covered for that amount of time after the game releases before you have to start manually insuring your ships.,2

"If you do this well, you can maintain your playerbase for many years, but not all games are amenable to this approach.

By comparison, a story-based game like bg3 is trying to do different things",1

"That's fine, that's simply the nature of story-based games -- after you've played through it, you want a new story",1

But...,0
researching shit can take fucking forever,2
I have a spreadsheet of how long shit takes to research,2
The last 3 things before t6 troops all have to be fully researched,1
Each one has 10 levels,0
"So, 30 things",0
"Thing is tho, level 10 of *each* is 256 days",0
That's 768 days (not hours) of just 3 things,0
Most people will just give up on the game (which the devs do not give a shit at all about..,1
because of the people I'm about to mention); and then there are those who will spend thousands of real dollars to buy speedups  and get those t6 troops asap,1
"That's just buying speedups and shit.

Then there's buying gold badges to rank up heroes and buying gold fragments to improve the heroes' skills and to awaken them",2
(They even sell exp books,0
"Not that many for just that much.)

Then there's Top Commander",1
I've mentioned it already under u /Xangis's comment to you,0
(Don't wanna ping them,0
It'd be annoying),2
But long story short,2
Some people will spend at least $500 each month or more on some new heroes,1
Then the combat aspect of the game....,2
"in events such as Archipelago Raid, Island Raid and Dark Seal, killing enemies doesn't give that many points actually",1
And your troops will die quickly,1
"And when they go to the hospital, of they cannot fit in there, they die permanently",1
"Most you can train at one time is 2,000 (without an expansion buff)",1
"With t5 troops, that's like 1 day and 12 hours",0
"When they die, up pops an offe to spend anywhere from 20 USD to 50 USD to buy ""Rebirth""",0
Just a couple hours of healing and training speedups,0
"(Say I got zeroed, my 1.6 million t5 troops would take 35 *days* to heal",0
But I can only house about 450k troops in my hospitals,0
So most would die.) Reason I bring this up? Because AR and IR are twice a month,1
Dark Seal used to be once or twice a month,2
Thank fuck they canceled it,2
But...,0
the devs are bringing something else back,0
All in all...,0
you gotta be rich to kill others in this game without dying that much yourself,1
"Or
..",0
just be a broke ass farmer.,0

"it is definitely not a skill issue - it is the game trying to give everyone a participant medal to keep them hooked.

  
oh and if i remember correctly, if you manage to kill one he is in final stand, can still shoot at you and eventually gets rescued by his teammate and revived so the kill wil lbe denied half of the time?
