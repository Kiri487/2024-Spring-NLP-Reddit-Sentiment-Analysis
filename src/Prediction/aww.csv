I just went and read it out of curiosity,0
"One of the reasons stated was that he likes doggy ice cream...

There's been a problem lately with pet owners realizing that to shirk this responsibility they can just say ""we're working on it"" when in actuality they do nothing or at most make a token effort with no real change",1
Of course I don't know what can be done about,0
"Truthfully if this dog was owned by folks more committed to weight loss than OP than the dog would already have lost weight by now/never gained weight in the first place.

Logically it makes sense",1
"People that care about their pet's weight will be careful from the beginning and probably won't ever have a pet that's obese, since they'll diet the pet when they first hit the overweight stage",1
"People that are lazy/avoidant/defensive won't be inclined to ever admit it's their responsibility, so they let their pet get obese and of course those are the ones less likely to do something about it.

There is a real problem with people getting their egos wrapped up in this issue too",2
"People don't like to hear they are doing something wrong, even if their pet suffers for it",2
I hope OP actually tries harder instead of blaming it on meds and ice cream,2
"I do think it would help if there weren't so many apologists ready to jump to their defense at every turn ""how do you know this pet wasn't adopted yesterday??"" exhausting",1
Just take care of your pets folks and stop putting it off and actually fix the problem,0
The dog will die of old age long before OP actually helps it lose weight I suspect :/,2
it's up to him,0

"Well, most of these is not about fawns, but okay",1
"I appriciate your help but it would have been nicer without calling me stupid or lazy considering I googled this topic, and on my mother tongue and every single link says otherwise",2
