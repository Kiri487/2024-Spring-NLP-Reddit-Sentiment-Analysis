There is a cartoon show called Centaurworld that will answer all your questions.,0

I like the idea of the one on the right - he could move like so fast and do cool dances I bet,1
"Actually it's neither because at the base of the neck it switches to human anatomy and even tho giraffes have long necks, humans don't.",2

Have you played Spore,0
I agree with this statement.,0
LOL this is cursed,1
Horses necks are generally proportional to their bodies,2
"They appear long because they stick up so much, but it's not nearly as disproportionate as a giraffe",1
Why the long face?,2
Happy cake day,1
The human half of a centaur starts at the base of the horse half's neck,2
"So, neither of these two options.",0

Uhm no..???????? Don't please??,0
"If CentaurWorld taught me anything, it's the Left one, and that is how it should be",0
I've few theories,2
"Do we have any intermediate species? I don't recall anything between very long giraffe neck and a neck like a horse.

Africa is huge, and the Savanah where they live is relatively flat and void of tall trees",1
I thing the long necks are used to conceal antennas that are utilized so the bird drones can communicate over longer distances.,2
"Random thought

Durpleton from Centaurworld,0
"Are you going meta? Do I even have a phone? Is this even real life? Someone call SCP, we have an issue",1

"Nah, centaurs don't have horse necks either",0
"Giraffe centaurs would be basically the same as ""normal"" centaurs as boring as that is",2
The main difference would be the pattern on their furs.,1
Neither,0
Centaurs' human torso doesn't have a horse neck or horse torso,0
It has a horse body with a human upper body replacing its neck,0
So a giraffe centaur should also simply have its neck replaced by a human upper body as boring as that would be,2
(Basically a normal centaur with slightly different fur on its body.),1
Except for that one recap episode in S2...,0
"I suggest ""Kipo and the Age of the Wonderbeasts"" if you like GF and Centaurworld.",0

How would left even live its arms aren't long enough to feed itself,1
yeah this just just my image of a regular centuar turn into a horse with a human head and i couldn't go back for a minute,0
"""At least have,"" not ""have at least.""",2
Neither is really related to centaurs though,1
They should at least have 4 legs and 2 arms.,2
But on a regular centaur isn’t the animals neck the humans torso?,0
John Cenataur there on the right,1
"Birds used to be real but were eventually replaced with drones.

Giraffes have never been real in the first place.",1
"Left makes most sense, but can you imagine having that reach on the right if you needed to lay the smack down on some fool.",1
"When I was little my dad would tuck me in at night, close the window and say “Wouldn’t want the *giraffe* to get you.” I pictured a rabid giraffe stepping over fences, putting its head through my bedroom window, and getting me.

*Draft.* I had hearing issues",2

"Centaurs are also fictional, this is a debate about fictional creatures",0
Obviously you split the difference.,0
Wouldn’t giraffes have to exist for either of these to be a possibility?,0
Some Giraffes are bigger then birds so can fit government spy’s inside,1
"The long “neck” is like a periscope with cameras, lenses and mirrors for the spy’s to see out",2
"It also acts as an antenna to communicate with the bird drones (what else do you think the two pointing things on top would be for?).
Most “giraffes” are stationed at “zoos” because otherwise people would think about them to much and realise they are fake.",1
