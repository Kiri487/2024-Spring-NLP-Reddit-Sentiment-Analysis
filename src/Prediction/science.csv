I believe you can get some papers that are certified home-compostable,0
"These are typically string and tag tea bags, the advantage of string and tag being that the bag itself is generally folded rather than heat-sealed, so it needs far less plastic",2
"It can then slip through the home-compostable standards (albeit these standards are changing), but it will still have a small amount that doesn’t fully disappear.

Not sure which country you’re in, but in the UK at least some homes presently have a food collection bin, which PLA teabags should go in or they can be put in a garden waste bin",2
"By 2026, all homes in England are expected to have a food waste collection, which is a good thing.",1
This is so dumb I can’t even get myself to write a rage post,2
Thanks for that discussion,1
"I, like many people I think, can’t put used teabags into the recycling stream",1

Modern 120mm anti-tank rounds generate 10x that and still can't punch through certain types of armor.,1
Plastic in teabag paper has two main purposes; number one is to allow for two sheets of the paper to be heat-sealed together and form the teabag,1
"The second purpose is to provide wet tensile strength - without the plastic content, a 100% paper bag would fall apart when added to water",2
"The plastic was typically PP, it’d been used for decades and pretty much all machines in the UK had been developed to run with it - it was consistent and reliable, but oil-derived and thus non-renewable and had no suitable waste stream other than landfill",1
"After public concern, the industry identified and began developing PLA paper as the alternative to PP",0
it had the advantage of being from a renewable source and could be industrially composted (essentially it needs certain temperature and moisture levels to degrade),1
"The issue was that PLA paper was horribly inconsistent at the start, essentially being new to everyone - the paper manufacturers and the teabag manufacturers",2
"It took a lot of time and money to get it to where it is now, most companies have it running relatively well, but it will likely never run as well as PP, so it’s added cost in terms of the paper itself and in inefficiency, both of which the consumer is now carrying",1
"I’m not aware of any credible alternative to PLA paper being worked on at present - the major hurdle is requiring it to be thermo-sealed, so it essentially has to have some form of plastic, being that an oil-derived one or a bio-plastic like PLA.",1

"Along with every stinko play of the day that civilians try to deal with, most Veterans are in separation pain; with retirement like drift and stall, trying not to flat spin over the aloneness that is typically compounded by relocating",1

The study investigated opioid initiation and long-term use after emergency department visits or hospitalisations across NSW by patient, admission and clinical characteristics",2
"The researchers found that from 2014 to 2020, overall opioid initiations decreased from 8.7% to 7.2%, and long-term opioid use decreased from 1.3% to 0.8%.

The study is the largest of its kind in Australia to date and suggests efforts to reduce opioid use post-hospitalisation have been successful.",1

Brain size does not always correlate directly with intelligence,1
"While there is some relationship between brain size and cognitive abilities, it is not a straightforward or universal rule",1
"Here are a few key points to consider:

1",2
Brain-to-Body Ratio (Encephalization Quotient - EQ): This ratio considers brain size relative to body size,0
"Species with higher EQs, like humans, dolphins, and some primates, tend to exhibit higher cognitive abilities",1
"However, this is not the sole determinant of intelligence.


2",0
Neuronal Density and Brain Structure: The number of neurons and their organization are crucial,0
"For example, birds like crows and parrots have relatively small brains but high neuron densities, allowing them to perform complex tasks and exhibit behaviors indicative of high intelligence.


3",2
Brain Regions: The development of specific brain regions is more critical than overall brain size,1
"In humans, the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in decision-making, planning, and social behavior, is highly developed compared to other animals.


4",1
Functional Adaptations: Different species have evolved brain structures suited to their ecological needs,1
"For example, some animals have highly developed sensory or motor areas in the brain to aid in survival rather than generalized intelligence.


5",1
"Human Intelligence: Humans have relatively large brains compared to body size, but more importantly, they have highly developed cerebral cortices that support advanced cognitive functions.


In summary, while there is some correlation between brain size and intelligence, it is not a definitive measure",1
"Factors such as neuronal density, brain structure, and the development of specific brain regions play significant roles in determining an animal's cognitive abilities.",1

I think it's better for the child if it's started earlier but harder to complete based on what our allergist said,1
"They did have 7 drop out entirely and 20 who just ""never got retested"" for whatever reason in that study, and that was only 69 children, so you can see why an allergist might be hesitant.

And they never ""complete"" the treatment",1
They complete the clinical administration and approval to give it at home instead of in the clinic,1

What do i do with this information?,0
"We asked our allergist about this, and that's not exactly how exposure therapy works, at least not for peanuts.

You can start it any time during childhood",2
Our allergist wouldn't do it before 5 because he says he has incredibly low success rates with children who start early because the instructions are tough to follow with young children,1
"Even with older children, it has limited success because it's not fun.

The kid has to eat the food, and then they have to just sit there for a while (hence why it's hard for young children)",2
But they can't sleep for a while after,0
And they can't go to school for a while after,0
They have to be watched by a parent or guardian in case of severe reaction,2
Any physical activity increases risk of anaphylaxis,0
"Anaphylaxis might occur, and then you have to go to the hospital and do the whole shebang there.

And the kid feels miserable",2
"Because they DO react, even if it's not severe.

After a while, the body becomes less dramatic about its reactions, but it still never LIKES the food.

And they have to do it daily for probably the rest of their lives to keep their reaction minimal.

The whole point of it isn't to erase the allergy",2
That never goes away,0
It's to minimize the chances of anaphylaxis upon exposure.,0

"Silibinin itself is a mixture of two diastereomers, silybin A and silybin B, in approximately equimolar ratio.[1] Silibinin is used in pure forms as a medication, and more frequently as an active ingredient in milk thistle–derived herbal supplements",1

I wish people understood this nuance,0
"It's led to so much judgment now when kids have allergies, as early introduction of allergens has been advised for about a decade now, so some people assume that parents with kids with allergies intentionally didn't listen to doctors and ""gave"" our kids allergies.

Hasn’t this been known for awhile? My kids are in their mid and late teens and when they were babies / toddlers our pediatrician told us to do this,2
I just mentioned New York City since it has the most Jews in one city in the world,1
"So the American Association of Pediatrics, which until 2015 advised that young children avoid peanuts and other allergens, is a non-scientific marketing body? No",2
"Sometimes ‘science’ is premature, studies are poorly designed, conclusions are inaccurate",2
I’m pretty sure “but public transportation doesn’t exist” is not a valid get out of DUI card with any police officer,1
"Do you think they care, if you’re being a danger on the roads?",0
"I am always fascinated by these fabulous descriptions of psychedelic trips! 

I have been using psilocybin for depression for 4 years",1
My first time was a psychedelic dose (not heroic dose) and I just hated the experience,2
It has solidly helped with my depression,0
One of the things I discovered is that my depression has an element of physical disturbances,0
"It’s REALLY helps with rumination! 

I say all of this because I really want to try ayahuasca, but I’m kinda nervous that I’m going to hate it and so I’m hesitant",2
I want the technicolor dream journey but I’m afraid I’ll be in hell.,2
"Certain food, with certain ingredients, and excluding many ingredients.

People running around feeding their kid JIFF aren't helping their kids.",1
Modern birds have had something like 66 million more years of evolution to get smarter.,1
Peanut allergies are still rare in the gen pop so your lack of exposing your children to peanut does not negate the evidence it just means your children were never predisposed to having peanut allergies which is awesome,1
Those bastards were on the verge of cold fusion when the asteroid hit.,2
Is this because they are dead by thirteen?,2
"Well, yes, but no.",0
"Is it even possible to measure cortical neurons from fossilized brains? Given that that's the current metric of how we define ""animal intelligence?""",0
"Reporting bias plays a part; I know a number of people who were at school with me in the 80s who swear that ""no-one at my school had food allergies""",0
"Yes, they did, Susan - I spent an afternoon in A&E instead of lessons with you because of them",2
"Interestingly, I was fed one of the foods that I'm allergic to (peas) from a very young age and didn't eat the other one (lentils) until I was 19, so expose doesn't seem to have played much of a part in my case",1
"Also interestingly, I'm not allergic to peanuts even though they're the same family as peas and I had no exposure to them as a child",1
"I don't like them much, but I can eat them.",1
"If memory serves Israel has the lowest rate of peanut allergies in the world, anecdotally it was viewed that a common food called Bamba (puffed peanut snack) made out of peanuts was the reason",2
"Children would choose the bear.

*\*sad noises\**",2
Potentially both,0
"My husband has a handful of food allergies, none super severe (but that can change)",1
"Our pediatrician told us that allergies generally aren't considered inherited, but being *prone* to allergies can be",2
"Basically ""don't expect your kid to be allergic to tree nuts but don't be too surprised if they're allergic to *something* common.""",2
One of the reasons I love Wikipedia so much is that to me it is like the embodiment of The Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy,1
I never excelled in school,2
"I am not very good with the structure of learning but Wikipedia has allowed me to find information on numerous topics and interests that have lead me to deeper explorations of topics and helped to unlock a world that I thought I did not belong in.

I am not an academic or researcher so my experience and utilization of Wikipedia is almost purely for knowledge for the sake of knowledge",1
"I understand that a big part of all levels of education is being about to source and present credible arguments using established sources but Wikipedia, to me, has been like a different avenue to an entire existence that I thought was inaccessible to me ( I was just never able to learn or write using the same methods that seemed to work well for my peers.) 

All of this is to say that I understand why you still caution against using Wikipedia as a credible source and I wanted to defend it as a non traditional avenue of exploration for people who may have been left out by more traditional aspects of education.

I find that is has tremendous utility and that the community is dedicated to the pursuit of approaching truth",1
I use this phrase because while facts exist the modern era has shown that the pursuit of truth is a constant struggle inside and outside of science and academia,1
"And as knowledge constantly seeks to update itself so do people try to corrupt the pursuit and subvert understanding to cultivate power, which if you look at the discussion parts of Wikipedia you will find can be really volatile",2
"And since our culture puts so little value on the pursuit of knowledge and puts such a high premium and monetary hurdle on knowledge especially after high school to the point where it isn’t cost effective or popular to seek it Wikipedia has always provided me a mostly reliable avenue to free myself from the chains of common thought which generally seems to be steeped in tradition, assumption, bias, morality and mythology",1
As someone who is forever scatterbrained I will always appreciate Wikipedia’s accessibility and commitment to annotation and perspective and knowledge.,0
I’m 40,0
I was the only kid in the school with a peanut allergy,0
I was also exposed to it lots as a small child,2
My mum ate it the entire time she was pregnant with me,0
"They found out I was allergic when some peanut m&ms made me violently ill as a toddler.
So I guess I’m just the statistical baseline that would have ended up allergic no matter what",2
Luckily my own kids don’t really have any food allergies.,1
"Or if you do buy boxes of mixed greens, get them from hydroponic growers.",0
"I think it’s more quick and easy just to eat something prepared quickly,  for the whole day",1
"When I sold a business that took up my whole day, I went into an eight month funk",1
I would only eat when I was dizzy from not eating.,0

Yeah,0
Unfortunately that advice was never based in science,2
It was one dude making the recommendation and for some reason it spread like wildfire.,1
"Zoning is a big issue for that too, there are no local bars in areas zoned for housing.",0
…my ADHD would find this very useful.,1
"Agreed, we need to retest 16-25 year olds every single year as they are a *terrible* age group for accidents",2
"You have to get to 80 year olds before you match their accident statistics.

Oh, whoops, that's not what you meant, now was it?",0
It depends on what you’re being exposed to,0
Some things do boost your immune system and help develop it,0
"But other things can damage your immune system and other aspects of health and development.

That’s one reason the “Old Friends”hypothesis has become more widely accepted to explain allergies, as opposed to the hygiene hypothesis that doesn’t really account for more damaging exposures we’ve reduced through better hygiene.",1
"Never lived in NYC, so I don't know what the local grocery situation is, but Wegmans carried it in upstate NY",0
Looks like Target also has it available online and at some of their stores in NYC,1
"In Florida Walmart, Target and Publix all carry it.",0

Now explain that to a five-year-old.,1
And I'd suggest it's only partially about how the tea is steeped - most big brands of tea in Ireland/UK don't even offer loose leaf,1
"There's very much a teabag culture, as you imply.",1
I'm 39 and I have one person my age that has a peanut allergy,0
I remember always getting peanut butter when I was younger so I guess that helped,0
I'm just answering your question,0
Its relevance to the post aside.,0
It would take million of years of sustained mining at a scale millions of times larger than possible today to deplete Neptune or Uranus,0
What are you on about?,0
Eat what you want to eat and bugger off.,0
"I didn’t say ‘oil’ I said ‘hydrogenated oil’, which was the heart health recommendation in the late 20th century",2
"This is now illegal it was shown to be so heart dangerous. 

No idea how you thought I advocate for a 0 carb diet",2
"Also in the late 20th century ‘low fat’ options were seen as healthy, when the replacement calorie when fat was removed was sugar. 

As for baby formula, again, completely disingenuous misrepresentation of my comment",1
"Baby formula was pushed as hygienic and superior to breast milk, and women were discouraged from breast feeding",1
This was part of a general trend of sterility and hygiene in the mid-late 20th century that has since been generally reversed and seen as harmful.,2
It seems like a lot of people just barely have the cognitive ability to drive,1
It doesn't surprise me that just a slight cognitive decline would cross the line into incompetency.,2
it's open access,0
"they included babies with allergic reactions, and the feedings were scheduled, if that's what you meant.",0
I don't know if I read it right but someone mentioned them writing dissertations on some pretty complex stuff so idk up until now they were pretty clever.,1
My mom was a 1-2 pack a day smoker from the time she was a teenager until she found out She was pregnant with me at 30,0
"The good news is 10 years after she quit cold turkey on her own, her doctor said that her health had returned to as if she had never started smoking cigarettes",1
"Unfortunately, my mom still continued to smoke weed, do Coke and who knows what else to this day",2
She’s in her early 70s,1
"We haven’t had communication for 10 years, after I was getting extremely concerned with her behavior and encouraged that she get an assessment from her doctor",2
"Both of my parents shouted me down and adamantly refused, and immediately returned to their behaviors exhibiting cognitive dysfunction",2

Initially fearful and preoccupied attachment styles have very similar correlations,0
What is used to set them apart is self-esteem,0
Self-esteem itself had the highest correlation,0
And obviously people with low self esteem have fearful or preoccupied attachment style,0
So even if we consider the data valid the conclusion is totally wrong,2
"Anecdotally, the reason is simply due to marketing",2
You are advertised to with pseudoscience,0
Advertising and stories on local news and even the evening news are hardly enough legitimacy for an individual to accept the claim that anything scientific or involving the scientific method was adhered to.,2
They didn’t “find” both of these studies are just speculations based off of models with different priors,0
They have been extinct for 65 million years,2
"We only recently discovered that corvids are more intelligent than chimps despite their small brains, so there is a huge range of possibilities for T-Rex but a speculative study does not overrule a previous speculative study.",1
"A lot of the ""bad advice"" you've mentioned isn't actually bad advice at all",2
"Many oils are lower in saturated fats, which means they are generally better for heart health and cholesterol",1
Carbs are actually an essential part of a healthy diet and are crucial for brain function,1
Baby formula has its flaws but is a perfectly fine source of nutrients for babies who cannot have breastmilk or for those who cannot or do not want to breastfeed,1
I think you may want to reconsider the validity and the biases of the information you are consuming,0
"Part of science is questioning what you believe to be true, which is why studies are done that often disprove previous theories and question ways of doing things",1
Science is always going to have contradictions and biases and as we move forward we are able to smooth out many of those contradictions and see and address those biases,1
Nutrition is no different.,0
"Several leaps of inductive reasoning from “size of the brain cavity” to “their behavior was like crocodiles and lizards”

My original questions was a bit of a misdirect since even if we had fossilized t-rex brains, it still wouldn’t tell us all that much about their behavior since we understand so little even about modern brains, much less ones from millions of years ago",1
I stop 2 times a day.,0
Get a salad spinner,0
It’s funny that you mention ice cream,1
There’s actually been huge outbreaks of food borne illness related to ice cream.,1
"There's actually a lot of developmental benefits to introducing food as early as 4 or 3 months.

That is, of course, assuming that the nutrition provided is beneficial as a supplement to the infants health",1
"However, official public health advice is written for the lowest common denominator, who can't be trusted to make positive dietary decisions for an infant- and so should exclusively breastfeed as long as possible.

It's a root cause to why so much parenting advice is contradictory- see also co-sleeping.",1
younger generations will also have access to rejuvantive medicine which will be a game changer with regards to aging,2
"No, in a study from earlier this year, they estimated evidence of intelligence largely on the size of the brain cavity relative to something (IDK), but this study argues that there needs to be more variables in account",1
and mud,2
lots of mud,2

Let kids play in the dirt!,0
Birds are very intelligent not just corvids and parrots.,1
I watched a documentary about leafy greens production in Yuma and it’s nuts just how close it is to the cattle feedlot,0
They’re right next to each other.,1
This would definitely be a great application for the hearing impaired,1
I do think though that it would be used for more nefarious things.,1
I got a really nasty case of campylobacter from eating yu choy,2
It was an awful 2 weeks,2
I basically lived in the bathroom.,0
"It's all those ""Never trust a Human"" messages on milk cartons.",0
Is this because they get more repetitions of information from their iPads and electronic devices than they do from humans until they start school?,1
"Yes, that’s a very important point",1
We risk becoming the ideological imperialists otherwise,1
"If we forced older people to stop driving in America, we might finally see the resurgence of good affordable public transportation",1
"Since old people actually go and vote, however the ruling class wouldn't need it since they already have chauffeurs.",1
"We need to surround a koala with trimmed eucalyptus leaves and nothing else, wait for it to expire and then recreate the perfect conditions for fossilisation so that future generations can know how god damn dumb these animals were

“He died starving surrounded by food”",1
This is decade-old news,1
It won't be as bad for younger generations as it is going to be for Boomers because that generation was exposed to stupid high amounts of lead in the environment.,2
"I don't know what data the model has been fed, but if it's observing timestamps, payload size, count, frequency--stuff that wireshark could tell you, it probably is",0
"It probably is because it seems to be educated with the unencrypted counterparts.

The info leak is either from a side-channel vulnerability, or the encryption algo is easily cracked.",1
"Fit under the law, and no, they're not allowed to drive or work in civilised countries btw",1
"But that's another debate america do not seems to want to have.

"It caused some problem when they decided to ban gaming for teens when a good portion of them are forced to work some time ago.

"Agree some people never do. 


I think it's well studied as a substance, almost everyone in sports takes it and it's generally considered extremely safe and well tolerated.",1

"Memory, problem solving, observation, concentration",0
"Not enough to be considered a disorder, but you know you're less than you were.",2
This is what I assumed too,0
"That it's because it's perceived as being from a legitimate source because robots ""can't lie""",0
"People who are depressed often seek outlets that make them feek momentarily good, while also building up shame that reinforces the depression",1
Porn/masterbation is an easily accessible source of both fleeting pleasure and extended shame.,1
"Many types of beans cannot and should not be eaten raw, and it has nothing to do with food born illnesses",1
A lot of beans have stuff inside them that will make you sick unless cooked to break it down.,2
Well..,0
yes and no,0
"Having a pet for young children rises the chance of the kid not developing an allergy at all, but if children that grew up with pets develop an allergy it tends to be more severe",1
"That was actually the conclusion of the same studies, but the second aspect doesn't make it into the headlines.",0
"Ok,  but most children under 6 don't backpack for fun  and wouldn't learn that most random people are nice, especially considering how ""stranger danger"" is still taught without nuance.",1

The brain could be smaller, but it's definitely not any larger.",0
This doesn't appear to be true given current psychopharmacology research,1
"There is some evidence for an increased risk in suicidality for adolescents in the first month or so of starting SSRIs, but outside of that, suicidality overall appears to decrease as a result of these medications",0
See ([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3353604/)) ([2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-021-01179-z)),0

"It reduces likelihood, it doesn't eliminate it.",0
"My son was born in 2014, and around that time they had just finished the first study",1
They were confused as to why peanut allergy is basically unheard of in Asia,2
"They found that it's likely because we let babies teeth on puffed snacks, and peanut oil, peanut powder, etc are popular ingredients",1
"We also just feed babies mashed up versions of our own meals, instead of bland baby food, so they end up being less picky",1
"My son had 2 teeth at birth, and could push his chest off the ground during tummy time by about 3 weeks old",1
"He got his first mashed solid at 1 month (still mainly on formula/breast milk, but had 1 or 2 solid things to try every couple days, since he already had 2 teeth)",1
One of the things he teethed on was puffed peanut treats,0
No allergies or sensitivities to this day,0
"My grandma started me on some solid foods at 1 month old, and I also have no allergies or sensitivities, aside from a sensitivity to milk and eggs that developed when I was in university",1

"I didn't know a single kid who had a peanut allergy growing up in the 80's, and I moved around a bit",2
Bee allergies were all the rage.,0
What about a potbelly pig?,0
Nope,0
They were branded and everything,0
"I even ordered them from the store for pickup during the pandemic - as soon as the little one was interested in nomming on things, we let her explore Bamba to try to head off peanut allergies.",1
"“They were more like smart giant crocodiles, and that’s just as fascinating.”

So were they or were they not “smart”?",1
Straight up not true at all,2
"They often do exposure therapy now with minuscule amounts after a reaction, with the idea that eventually it helps reduce reactions.

The exposure therapy is generally most successful though if started early (before age 1).",1
"I have to push against this politely and reiterate what some are saying, yes high density can be loud but it’s not nearly as loud as more spread out living is",1
So many people are forced to live near very busy highways,1
"I’d rather live in a higher density area with the occasional car or delivery truck over constant cars driving past on a highway.

I lived in Paris briefly and even though I lived in a high density area it was super quiet on my street and the streets around me and there were several parks in walking distance that were surprisingly VERY quiet",1
And that was before the new mayor started pushing for less car traffic,2
"I’m not saying there weren’t areas of Paris that were noisy but it was way more quiet than you’d expect and that had a lot to do with there being everything you needed within a 10 minute walk, a grass-covered tram, and an underground metro stop a few minutes walk away.",1
"If you’re starting out with a 6 month old baby as they recommend here, it would not be actual peanuts, but smooth peanut butter.",1
A ton,0
"The reason they figured it out was because in Israel, they were not given the advice to restrict peanuts",0
"And there, Bamba peanut butter puffs are a big first baby food",1
"Israelis in the UK had an explosion of peanut allergies, whereas the ones still in Israel, had no change.",0
I’m not sure that is true,1
Most are rather intelligent.,1
"No, a lot of recent research has suggested some theropod groups like Troodontids, dromeaosaurs (raptors), and Tyrannosaurs were relatively intelligent",1
"Even looking at modern theropods (birds), groups like corvids and parrots are amongst the most intelligent animals on the planet.",1
These modified noise-makers are so insane,2
I really wish noise pollution would be taken seriously,2
"I live in a neighborhood with dozens of large apartment complexes, each with hundreds of units, and there are some nights some idiot comes tearing through with their loud vehicle at 2 or 3 am waking me and my household up",2
I have members in my family who have insomnia and if that happened around them they’d just be up the rest of the night,0
"Not to mention the parents with babies, doctors and nurses who work long shifts just to be woken up an hour or so after falling asleep, etc",2
It’s dangerous.,2
"If you are super paranoid and want to try this, put your child in the car, drive to the local emergency and pay to park in the lot",1
"Then give it to them, if anything happens you’re already parked at the hospital.",0
i honestly thought thus was already a well known thing,1
"When you keep your house too clean, you deprive children’s immune system of germs which leave them untrained for more serious interactions with those germs later on",1
Dogs in children’s homes offset this,0
Cats to a lesser degree do as well.,0
"This is interesting and confirms what doctors have been telling parents for over a decade, but as a parent of a kid with a peanut allergy, please don't lecture us about it as though we wanted our kids to have a life threatening allergy",1

No kidding? With all the parents demanding removal of peanuts because they fear their children will die of peanuts only to make their children be more allergic to more ingredients,1
It's a pattern that I've observed.,0
"Bambas were how we discovered our 6-month old had a peanut allergy.

I'm hearing now that peanut exposure is vital *in utero* - by the time they get to 4-6 months it's too late and the allergy has already developed.",2
"For me it was Optimus Prime! Moral leader with strong integrity and an unflinching desire to do the right thing, no matter what!",1
"Fair point, though the headline is a bit suggestive.",1
"In Mexico, people soak their vegetables and fruits in tap water and add a bit of Microdyn (or similar product) and let it sit dor a bit",0
It kills what's on the produce and also what's in the water,0
You can't smell or taste it,0
I believe the active ingredient is colloidial silver,2
"Doing this in the US, also, would largely obviate this contamination issue.

In Mexico,  we consider leafy greens the food most likely to be contaminated (and especially lettuce)",1
I know I've seen too many future apocalypse movies but this world seems like a bad plot,2
The newest generation of humans are growing up with a preconceived notion that AI is their all knowing friend,0
"Yup, I see where you're going with this James Cameron.",0
"The 80s-00s was also the ""Don't eat dirt!  Sanitize religiously!  Keep kids away from germs!"" era",0
"Medical thinking changed around 2015, and now parents are told ""Dirt is okay in moderation!  Germs are okay in moderation!  Expose their immune systems to icky stuff early because if you don't they go crazy and start attacking their body and that's how you get allergies.""

Given that my first (born a couple years before COVID) and third (born this year) came out seemingly without any major allergies but my second (COVID baby) has a peanut allergy and all sorts of eczema/skin stuff, there may be something to that.",1
This is the important part,1
"They controlled for confounds:

“Logistic regression models were controlled for individual-level, family-level, and area-level confounders, and e-values were calculated to estimate residual confounding.”",0
And Ayahuasca retreat participant coworkers report a 100% increase in boring Ayahuasca stories.,2
Was this an allergy concern or a choking hazard concern?,0
Always in the gym and hot box equals no time in your schedule for psychosis,1
"One of my biggest hopes is that we build our cities and towns to be more walkable.

We need cars too because not everyone will be physically fit enough to walk, or might need a self driving car to go to the doctor or see family or something.

But many people will never be able to afford a self driving car",1
Even today many elderly people can’t afford assisted living facilities,1
"Many are becoming homeless too.

Having a walkable city means the elderly can still have a life outside of their home without driving that is affordable and accessible.

But first we have to legalize medium density housing.",1
My poop comes out of my black hole.,2
I can’t wait for the drug prices to come down….,2
wait… what’s that?…,0
Sorry I’ve just been informed it’s really not that much cheaper so the prices will be going up to compensate the share holders.,2
Who recommended or endorsed this strategy? My kids were born in that era and our pediatrician made such recommendations,0
"They aren’t some nutball, I’m sure they were following norms in the medical community",1
"I’m not an expert in this field, but a Google search indicates the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended toddlers avoiding peanuts etc until 2015",0
"Some pollutants reflect or block sunlight and cool the atmosphere. 

Other pollutants trap heat and warm the atmosphere. 

We’ve managed to cut down a bunch of the first type, but still emit a huge amount of the second type.",1
This is a 100% correct answer,0
I'll stake my entire reputation on it!,0
Or just building cities differently,0
"4000 home developments without any commercial space for a grocery store, hardware store, park, school..",0
Of course you need a car when they only way to get *anything* is to drive 20 minutes,0
"A bus route doesn't solve that issue, really.",1
"Yeah, I'd hope more people in /science would appreciate that 'common wisdom' is often wrong.",2
"So… did the scientists of 2005 telling people to avoid giving their kids peanuts or strawberries not know about this method?  

I’m not questioning the validity of science, writ large",1
Science is cool,1
I am questioning the strength of studies in certain fields,1
Nutrition seems to be one of the least replicable (this is needed for the scientific method) and the most variable in outcome fields,1
"Lots of bad advice has come from this field (hydrogenated oils to replace saturated fats, baby formula over breastfeeding, replacing fats with low quality carbs, avoiding allergen exposure, over-sterility of foods and ignoring gut biome etc)",2
"These errors are very apparent in hindsight, and I think it is unlikely that nutrition scientists of 2024 are immune to the errors of just a few decades ago (they are often the same people, or contemporaries, or mentees of those who made those errors).",2
Major limitations in drawing meaningful conclusions with this methodology,1
"The authors state:

""we were unable to account for familial disposition for mental disorders, quality of life, use of drugs such as cannabis or an indicator of social deprivation, which are all potential confounders",2
"Third, the results cannot be generalized to women, other age groups and other populations",2
"Fourth, we could not assess the association between sauna bathing and risk of psychosis when comparing people who used sauna versus people who did not use sauna at all, because of the small numbers (n = 12) who did not use sauna at all",2
"Indeed, sauna use is a tradition in Finland and the majority of people use the sauna at least once per week""",2
"Enjoy them while they last, I have a feeling Uranus and Neptune are the two planets most likely to be dissembled for materials and fuel first.",1
Why warm water specifically?,1
"We can consume less raw vegetables, i.e",2
"salads, and switch to more cooked vegetables",1
The potential loss in nutrition is minimal,0
"Just look at the diets of the Okinawan people, one of the healthiest people on the planet",0
They don't eat raw salads as a rule.,2
"i don’t use the phrase conspiratorial thinking anywhere in the article, that phrase refers to a particular psychological disposition

but yea, belief in conspiracies is counted whether or not the particular belief is true",1
some conspiracies are real and some are not,1
"they fit the category of conspiracy regardless (standard definition is private plot of the powerful)

this isn’t a study of false beliefs, it’s a study of conspiracy beliefs",1
My guess is that this is children picking up on social cues,1
"Are their *parents* displaying more trusting attitudes towards other people, or electronics? Does Mom get more nervous dealing with a teller at the bank, or an ATM? And, by extension, how comfortable are these kids around people, vs",1
around inanimate objects? How dangerous do they perceive them each to be?,2
"I know you *think* it's pointless research, but it isn't",0
I'm sorry you can't see that.,2
I've always felt a basic cognitive test for all drivers renewing their license at 65+ years old should be mandatory,1
Even if it's a basic reaction time test and impared vision test,0
An average above X amount of time and/or objects unnoticed is a disqualification for license renewal.,2
This has been known for a while.,0
The problem is waste from animal farms getting on them,2
"And no, for some dangerous bugs not unless you cook them",2
Which is not how most people eat them,1
This is why you should try to only by whole heads instead of boxes of mixed greens,1
this was exactly what I was thinking,1
