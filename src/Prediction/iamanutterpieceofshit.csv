She should still be punished.,0
Because people were being accused of doing things like this to children at the same time,0

I think the RAPE part is why Bill Cosby was prosecuted,0

**Masten Wanjala: Mob beats Kenyan child serial killer to death - police**  


  
A mob in western Kenya has killed a self-confessed serial killer who escaped from custody two days ago, police say",2
"Masten Wanjala, 20, was traced by villagers to a house in Bungoma town and beaten to death, they say",0
Authorities had launched a massive manhunt for the fugitive who admitted to killing more than 10 young boys during a five-year period,1
He also confessed to drugging them and in some cases drinking their blood,0
"He reportedly returned to the home of his parents - who have disowned him - and was subsequently strangled by neighbours who found out he was there, an eyewitness told Kenya's Standard newspaper.

  
He tried to stave off suspicious locals by moving to a nearby house, Bungoma's police commander told the paper",2
"It is thought his family identified the body, although a police spokesperson said they are still doing ""basic verification"" to make sure the deceased is indeed Wanjala, according to Reuters news agency",1
"""We are not sure how he managed to travel all the way from Nairobi to his rural home,"" Musyoki Mutungi said",2
"""It is the curious villagers who first identified him and went ahead to kill him even before the police could be informed.""  


  
The mother of one of the victims told the BBC she wanted to know why he did what he did",1
"""I would have loved to see him in court, so that I get to know why he did this - why he brutally killed our children and left us with pain,"" Grace Adhiambo said",2
The badly decomposed body of her teenage son Brian Omondi was one of four recovered by police on the outskirts of the capital Nairobi in July,2
A post-mortem carried out by the government pathologist showed they had been strangled and hit on the head with a blunt object,2
"Wanjala killed his first victim when he was just 16 years old, a similar age to some of his victims",1
"He posed as a football coach to lure his victims to secluded areas, after which he attacked them",0
In some cases he took them as hostages for ransom,0
"The killings took place in Nairobi, and areas of eastern and western Kenya",0
Three police officers who were on duty when he escaped on Wednesday have been charged with aiding the escape of a suspect and negligence,0
Police say they noticed he had disappeared during the morning roll call,0
There was no sign of a break-in at the prison cell,0
"In a series of tweets, the Kenyan Directorate of Criminal Investigations expressed regret that Wanjala did not face justice",2
"It said ""the law of the jungle as applied by irate villagers prevailed""",2
"There are growing calls for the resignation of Kenya's police chief over the escape, which shocked the nation and and led many on social media to ridicule the police",1
"Wanjala's killing by mob justice two days later however is a tragic reminder of the deep anger, hate and frustrations that many Kenyans feel for the National Police Service",2
"Kenyans saw this as an open-and-shut case, which the police bungled",0
"After more than three months of investigations, Kenyans are asking why was Wanjala never taken to court to face murder charges?  


  
It raises questions about Kenya's judicial process - whose wheels often grind slow, and in this case, were completely broken, destroying the hopes for justice for families of the victims.",2

Op likely copied from a British news article,0
"Kinda lazy, but it makes sense for the title.

As for why news publishers do this, whenever an incident happens overseas, there has to be a link to the country it‚Äôs posted in unless it‚Äôs incredibly major, or it‚Äôs not seen as relevant.

For example: 2 Australians killed after Spanish hit and run, or with major events such as MH370, 6 Australians among 239 passengers missing after MH370 disappearance.

Nobody really cares about minor events such as hit and runs, stabbings, etc, especially when it happens in another country",1
"If the publisher wrote ‚ÄúFour children critically injured after being stabbed in a lakeside park in the French Alps‚Äù, the story would get no traction in Britain.",2

Now those policies are gone so it‚Äôs more spread out over different demographics,1
I‚Äôd argue There‚Äôs already no predominant skin color for this,0
"There‚Äôs tons of videos of white people being trashy, Latino people, even Asian people",1

"Nothing to do with color of the skin, everything to do with generations of poverty and poor education",2
I pity these people and fucking loathe them,2
"And they come in blinding shades of white too, mainly from the same places",1
American politics and bullshit paved the way for this and encouraged it....and wouldn't you fucking believe it - beyond their wildest imaginations (they knew what they were doing and didn't give a fuck - no doubt *somebody* realized that it would affect an entire social class and not just a racial group) it took the fuck off and effects are felt by all Americans who aren't too wealthy to be insulated,2
Wait 20 or 30 years and I don't think there will be any distinctly predominant skin color in videos like this,0
Because it all comes down to socioeconomics,2
And that shit was fucking planned and it's backfired,2
And it was a horrible fucking plan,2

"If you grind down a stick of chalk on wet sidewalk/pavement, it makes for great temporary facepaint/hair dye",1
It would also be a fun way to use that wasted water!,1
"Wtf is wrong with people...

I'd buy that kid all the chalk she wants just to spite that old witch",2
"Five black cops, who, now that the story is out, seem to have had a personal grudge against this man",2
They killed him,2
They got fired and are being charged with murder,0
"To suggest anyone besides the five officers has done anything inappropriate is asinine.

Even if you believe something inappropriate happened, there was never, ever a white person anywhere near this, so you're just putting your predetermined ideas on this case, not weighing it on its own merits",1
"You decided before any evidence came out that white people were both A) involved, and B) guilty",2

You'll grow out of it once you start using the principle of charity,0
Argumentation isn't about you showing you are right and especially about a topic you don't care enough to read about..,1
it's about exchanging ideas and both people adjusting their beliefs or lack of beliefs in response to new information,1
"For clarity, when you said it's not the same person in power making all the decisions, I'm not even sure what that has to do with the topic other than it being an eject button you can push to guarantee you feel like your ego wasn't hurt online by being unfamiliar with an extremely complex topic.",2
