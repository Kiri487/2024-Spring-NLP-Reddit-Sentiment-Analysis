"The way music works is the constant peaks and valleys created with the use of tension building and then releasing that tension.

If you skip to what I'm assuming you mean chorus when you say ""the meat"" - you aren't getting the pay off that is the release of the tension",2

So many of the best songs take 2 or 3 minutes of ""edging"" before the big pay off",1

Proud Mary by Tina Turner is a prime example of this,1
In The Air Tonight by Phil Collins is another,0
