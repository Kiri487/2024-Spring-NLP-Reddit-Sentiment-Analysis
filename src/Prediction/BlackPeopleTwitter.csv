"The way music works is the constant peaks and valleys created with the use of tension building and then releasing that tension.

If you skip to what I'm assuming you mean chorus when you say ""the meat"" - you aren't getting the pay off that is the release of the tension",2
"Verses exist to build the tension, the chorus releases that tension.

So many of the best songs take 2 or 3 minutes of ""edging"" before the big pay off",1
"Because the longer the tension builds, the more emotional impact there is when it is released",1
Proud Mary by Tina Turner is a prime example of this,1
In The Air Tonight by Phil Collins is another,0
"Bohemian Rasphody by Queen, the list goes on.

If there is no tension before the release, then its not a release",0

When someone demanded to know whether she was posting from her taxpayer-provided first iPhone or her taxpayer-provided second iPhone she insisted that she was using a taxpayer-provided third iPhone:
