It's the same thing you eat eggs you eat grown chickens but baby chickens are where you draw the line? You have no issues butchering them while they are grown up but eating them while they are still young is horrifying and makes you throw up? Huh?,2

Porn is ruining young peoples lives,1
"That's fair, I can't say it wasn't disgusting.",1
"I mean, most of the stuff you watch as a kid and preteen are cartoons (for me at least)",2
So statistically you develop a few crushes on cartoon characters (Jessica Rabbit my beloved) and hentai / cartoon porn follows fairly naturally from there as a first step,1

"There is **so** much porn out there, and it is so easy to find literally every kind imaginable",1
You absolutely need to have a conversation with your children about it,1

No, I don't think you should kink shame or say everything that isn't vanilla is bad, but they do need to understand the difference between porn and healthy sexual consenting relationships",2

hopefully u have it set up to where it blocks out the very suspicious sites like xhamster and shit

on the hentai thing, since she doesn't know what it is or even regular porn for that matter, once she finds out what it is two of things will happen she will either get into it or won't like it,


but because she knows about ur kid safety on her laptop obviously she didn't know what it was, nor the fact it is porn so in that case i actually don't see a problem here

unless she likes it occasionally monitor it, just make sure she doesn't find herself into the dark side of hentai",1

"The goal isn't to say ""here you go kid, access to the internet, go wild"" then secretly spying on them, yelling at them at the first inappropriate search result and breaking their trust",1
The goal is to make them understand that the internet can be an unsafe place and that it's for their safety.,0

12 is the age you start going through puberty and it's also the kind of age you start talking to strangers online about more adult topics or at least it was for me,1

The check/regulation of content which your child (tries) to consume on the internet (which obviously searches for content absolutely not made for its age group) is not toxic,2

"Ah, I see you are taking the classic, tried-and-true, Reddit Hivemind^(TM) approach to online discourse.",1
Is it just me or is it weird to spy on your kid like this at that age? For like a 6 year old sure but at 12 you're starting puberty and deserve privacy.,1
"Just in my 30s, and also work with kids, a big part of the slang is just the latest meme, and the fact adults roll their eyes at it makes it better",1
"Reminds me of when I was in school, the “so randum” 2005 phase had us saying cryptic stuff (or things like ‘salad fingers’) that adults would have no clue about but we all knew it was just being random",2

"When I left school sigma (a play on alpha/beta ) was around, followed by shrigma 2020(?)

"It’s a way for kids to show they are also up to date with trends, to fit in, and they aren’t one of the adults or people who get perplexed",1

Then wrongly using their memes as cringey as possible “when is the sigma?”,2
Yeah you should probably think about why you didn't expect to have to talk to your teen about sex and porn,0
And 12 is a ripe age for that talk,0
And googling what a word means they just picked up and following their curiosity is the most innocent and normal approach one can expect,1
"I hope you didn't actually blame them for looking up the meaning of a word, or for developing a sexual interest in their puberty",1
"Your role is to explain things, set boundaries, and probably activate parental controls for safe searches if you feel that'll be necessary.",1
"Parents should only explain the basics of sex and protection, everything else should be left for the kids to explore themselves",0
It's fine to protect your kid on the internet through monitoring apps.,1
But posting and embassing them defeats the purpose,0
"Think how they gonna react to the monitoring and a post about it? Even if we don't know them, it's an embarrassing feeling.",0

Trying to control that curiosity will only cause your kid to mistrust you and to become better at lying and hiding stuff from you.

While I agree with you in general that that age is fine to learn all that,1
"It sounds to me that someone DID explain to the kid, but he didn't quite get it completely",0
"Cuz he's like 5 and they don't always get everything right, even when it's explained",1
"But I mean, the basic gist of the actual process is there",2
I think he'll be fine by the time he's at the age it becomes relevant to him personally.,1

"While Benjamin was right to use an Uber against an RU pokemon, Benjamin failed to realize that Mewtwo is a wallbreaker and not something that is a good defensive type against Gengar (although if focus sash was used, Mewtwo could 1 shot Gengar with a Life Orb boosted STAB Psystrike)",1
On point,0
"Gengar would be if choice scarfed as Mewtwo's main comp set as of SV usually utilizes HDBs, Leftovers or Life Orb to compliment its 154 base attack (Gengar with Scarf and Timid would have a speed of 525 while Mewtwo without Choice Scarf would have a 394 Speed- though it should be noted that Mewtwo with scarf would be faster (at the cost of the move coverage it needs to stay viable as a wallbreaker that can easily be countered).

Please note:

The stats used are based on the typical strats used in Smogon for Pokemon Scarlet/Violet and this comment exists to be a nerd about a topic I like rather than to be a contrarian",2
"In my opinion, what is shown in the video qualifies as having normal human emotions, especially for a child, who is allowed to have worse emotional regulation than adults",2
I don't understand how simply crying is throwing a tantrum,2
The child is clearly not doing that on purpose to be manipulative,2
"To me, they just appear overwhelmed by emotion in a way which is beyond their control",0
The only person in the wrong here is whoever recorded this video and posted it to the internet.,2

Yes  having parents respond to his crying by filming him so he can get cyberbullied surely means that he will have a happy and fulfilling childhood,1
I didn't do shit,2
He's crying,2
There's a reason,0
What is the reason? It needs to be addressed.,0

"Yep sorry about that, already made the correction",2
Though I wonder if a focus sash was involved or Gengar was able to tank an attack (very unlikely),2
I might also be overthinking this and the little guy decided to set up in front of a super effective sweeper 🤡,1

What else could they have done,0
Gengar isnt faster under normal circumstances,1
where tf are parents,0
"I’d probably say, let’s take a break and end the game there",2
Then take the kids to a seperate room and let everyone else either play another game or do whatever they want,2
"Then when I’m with the kid, let him calm down and then talk to him about what happened when he’s ready",1
I’d bet he’s probably tired and just frustrated,2
No more uno for him tonight,1
Not as a punishment but because he’s not able to play without getting too upset right now.,1

"To be fair Gengar also has a weakness to Mewtwo's attacks, it all comes down to who is the fastest(~~Gengar~~).

"There are tricks you learn to increase your odds of winning and when you're versing kids they can be a huge advantage.





Holding your skips or + cards to combo into an unstoppable UNO/win instead of using them aggressively when ever you get them and all that sort of stuff.





Knowing when to take the +4 instead of stacking yours on because you have a combo to play.




Now I'm thinking about it there is a bit of skill and meta gaming to uno.",1
