on the hentai thing, since she doesn't know what it is or even regular porn for that matter, once she finds out what it is two of things will happen she will either get into it or won't like it,


but because she knows about ur kid safety on her laptop obviously she didn't know what it was, nor the fact it is porn so in that case i actually don't see a problem here

Yeah you should probably think about why you didn't expect to have to talk to your teen about sex and porn,0
And 12 is a ripe age for that talk,0

"Your role is to explain things, set boundaries, and probably activate parental controls for safe searches if you feel that'll be necessary.",1

On point,0
"Gengar would be if choice scarfed as Mewtwo's main comp set as of SV usually utilizes HDBs, Leftovers or Life Orb to compliment its 154 base attack (Gengar with Scarf and Timid would have a speed of 525 while Mewtwo without Choice Scarf would have a 394 Speed- though it should be noted that Mewtwo with scarf would be faster (at the cost of the move coverage it needs to stay viable as a wallbreaker that can easily be countered).
