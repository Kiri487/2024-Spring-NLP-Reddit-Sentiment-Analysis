Humans have used coal since ancient times,0
It was instrumental in our advancement of metallurgy,0

"God this historical take is so tired.

1) Populations in Europe stopped growing exponentially pretty much by post WW1, yes there's still growth in Western Countries through immigration but the population differences are not nearly as large as they are in the developing world.

2) Technologies of the past were inherently way less efficient, like we're talking an order of magnitude if not even less efficient in terms of the value that could be gained from pollution.

3) Historical reasoning is shit because it totally ignores the fact that we're staring down the barrel of the dual problems of population growth/economic development in developing countries",1
"China will have more historical emissions than the USA within this decade, in fact, it will have more historical emissions than the EU + USA combined probably by mid 2030",1
"Southeast Asia + Indian subcontinent + Africa has about 8 billion people trying to go through the same process (by the time in which it happens), which we simply cannot afford as a planet.

4) OECD average emissions *per capita* is lower than China's",2
USA and Canada are outliers,0
Nevermind that cold environments inherently have much higher emissions,2
"The best thing that can be done is advocating for less suburban living, but the reality is that people really like suburbs, as any country develops economically, they get more and more suburbs - so the next best thing is population reduction (most immigration to western countries should not be happening from an environmental perspective, though I guess its ok going from China to Europe now lol)

  
Climate change would've been much more easily resolvable if the UN sterilization programs of the 1960s were allowed to continue and the developing world was transitioned to 2-3 births per woman, considering that short of cutting down important forests and environmental reserves, many countries in the developing world can't really feed themselves all that well and rely massively on exports on the international market for stability",1
"The combination of food insecurity + young populations makes wars far more likely for people of the developing world (which continues to empower the poverty cycle).

World should've been capped to 4-5 billion until we figured out more efficient technologies either technical or social, because we've way overshot on our land use numbers.

Just look at Egypt, Egyptians would be so much better off if there was 1/4 as many Egyptians as there are now, that's a country that's incapable of getting better because there simply isn't enough resource accumulation for people to advance up to the next stable point in terms of social development.",1

Yes there’s a bacteria developed to consume PET plastics,0
"But not only is this a fraction of the plastics polluting the planet, the research won’t likely be mature enough to implement this at a scale that outpaces our currently massive production of plastics",1

">The idea that a lack of fungi able to decompose lignin during the Carboniferous period was relevant for coal specifically, not all fossil fuels (e.g",1
"Robinson, 1990)",0
"However, it appears this was likely not the case, and the abundance of coal formed during the Carboniferous not because of a lack of the right fungi (they were around), but because of a confluence of the right tectonic setting and climate conditions, i.e., lots of extremely wet and flat areas to produce abundant swamps providing the right geochemical conditions for fossil fuel formation (e.g",1
"Nielsen et al, 2016).

>What are those right conditions? In short, those that lead to the ""correct"" kind of organic material being buried in high abundances",1
"A basic understanding of the long term carbon cycle here is useful (e.g., Berner, 2003), but very broadly the three (sometimes related, or at least coincident) characteristics that lead to those conditions are (1) high productivity (i.e., an area where a lot of organic material is being produced), (2) rapid burial of organic material (i.e., a high sedimentation rate that coupled with high productivity can allow for decomposition to be outpaced by deposition and burial) and (3) anoxia",1
"In detail, the majority of geologic time periods and paleoenvironments in which large scale fossil fuel deposits were formed were characterized by large anoxic events (e.g",1
"Demaison & Moore, 1980)",0
"As discussed in Demaison & Moore (and lots of other others), there are a variety of scenarios that can lead to anoxia from global (i.e., a global anoxic events like those that occurred a few times during the Cretaceous, e.g., Leckie et al., 20020) to local (e.g., restricted in/outflow of water bodies like the conditions that exist currently to produce anoxia in the Black Sea, e.g., Arthur & Dean, 2010)",2
"Again referencing Demaison & Moore, there are bacteria and chemical pathways that do breakdown organic material in anoxic conditions (i.e., it's not that anoxic conditions mean that there is no decomposition happening), but these are less efficient than those happening in the presence of oxygen and most importantly tends to leave behind byproducts rich in lipid and hydrogen, which (along with the biomass of these anaerobic decomposers themselves) are the right type of organic material to eventually be formed into fossil fuels.

>In short, it's not actually that the organic material is not decomposed at all, but it needs to be decomposed in the right way (i.e., via anaerobic pathways that are dominant in anoxic marine environments)",1
"This along with lots of starting organic material and fast rates of burial lead to the correct conditions for fossil fuels to form.

"> With average crop yields remaining at the 1900 level the crop harvest in the year 2000 would have required nearly four times more land and the cultivated area would have claimed nearly half of all ice-free continents, rather than under 15% of the total land area that is required today.


What an incredible change this brought to farming yields.",1

We have been genetically manipulating plants and animals for millennia,0
"It is what allowed humans to stop relying on hunting and gathering, but instead do agriculture",0
Without genetic manipulation (in those days by cross breeding instead of testtubes and crispr) we would never have become the human race we know today.,0

 As long as we have electric lights and refrigeration we would be in a good position to start developing technology again",1
It might even take less time because we have a good idea of what is possible and what is useful,1

Have you read the Genesis recently? I’m not an expert but I can somewhat answer your first question,1
God did not intend to make Eve in the first place,1
"God wants Adam to take care of Eden, but turns out, he needs a helper",1
God look through His creation and cannot find any being who fits the job,0
So God subsequently created Eve,0
I’m not so sure about what you mean by charade,2
"However, I can say that taking a ribs out of Adam to creat Eve has its symbolic meaning in marriage etc, that I’m not quite equipped to elaborate",1
"Word to the wise, if you take Genesis literally, you’ll find it quite baffling",1
"God is omniscient and omnipotent, as to why He does what he does is not a question anyone can answer for sure",1
"But I’m here to point out some obvious discrepancies you made(Adam has a womb), it’s beyond me to answer your theological question, like why God didn’t do this.",0

"But you started the conversation stating that in Italy pasta is a side dish, it is not",0
"We don't usually have a full 3/4 courses meal when at home (if not for special occasions), but still every dish is clearly separated in ""primo"" or ""secondo"" or ""contorno"" (first course/second course/side dish) even if it is the only course in that meal.
And pasta is clearly a ""primo"", not a side dish.

For example yesterday for lunch I prepared tomato sauce pasta and a side of cabbage with yogurt and walnuts",1
"But first we ate the pasta by itself because it is a ""primo"" and only then we ate the side dish (that would go with a ""secondo""), we would never mix or invert them",1
