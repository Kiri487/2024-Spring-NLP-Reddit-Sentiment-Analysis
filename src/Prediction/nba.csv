sentence,prediction
So what hapens when all the top 10-15 refs die or retire,1
People would just stop watching the NBA because the refs arent good enough?,1
"This an insane comment 💀 

Send da video",2
Idk what this is even but it's not basketball,0
Well does he want any?!?,0
You could have cut that sentence off after the word negative and it would have been just as valid.,2
"Gobert isn’t getting matchup hunted except at the perimeter by two of the best guards in the nba, and I can think of plenty of dpoy players that would be matchup hunted in that scenario",1
Put dwight/noah/gasol/chandler out to guard luka on the perimeter and the mavs would take that 10/10 times because it’s a big defending a superstar guard.,0
Wade and Bosh were bus riders too,0
So was either Shaq or Kobe,0
"That is *not* the definition, you just made it up",0
It was used to refer to someone that hops on a team that is already gonna win,1
Cavs were not winning if Kyrie wasnt there.,2
"Harden, Jokic, Luka",0
Fat fuckers keep getting away with it.,0
"Those are normal decisions, find a new slant.",1
He’s had games like this his entire career,0
A significant reason he’s not as valuable as a lot of people think he is.,1
"And 1,500 fouls a day",0
KAT doesn’t pass the three point line so either Luka jumped into him or he shot inside the 3 point line so it’s not 3 free throws.,1
"Hear me out: 

The NBA should look at it like the WWE",0
I mean the NBA has been shrewdly making money as an ENTERTAINMENT business anyway since David Stern took over,2
The announcers are definitely part of the performance and they should be able to say anything,1
"The bolder the better.

WWE popularity took off once it stopped pretending to have integrity.",1
"CJ did not get locked up by Rondo, he scored 25 ppg on 61% true shooting In the series",1
And Dame was basically constantly double (and often triple) teamed and trapped by AD and Jrue together,0
"It was hardly Dame or CJ being ""locked up"" in single coverage",2
I've never seen an NBA team sellout more to stop one guy in a playoff series than the Pelicans did to Dame that year.,1
I was following bro posts until he said this brain dead shit,2
I used to be jealous of Aaron Afflalo,0
"Yeah I feel like 90% of the commenters here don't even watch the games, that's why the narrative keeps changing",0
"They just look at 3 stats (pts/rebounds/assists) and think ""wow I guess he wasn't bad""",1
That doesn't mean he doesn't have friends & family still in the trap,1
Just because he made it kinda sorta don't mean everyone around him did.,1
Not to mention not having their best player for their home games,1
Yeah and also because the stats don't represent how bad he was in G1/G2,2
Even KAT is probably like 20/10/4 now but I don't know how anyone could argue that he wasn't horrible before G4,1
">we might be comparing the Lakers' 2020 Mickey Mouse Bubble Championship to a potential Celtics' 2024 Asterisk Hospital Championship...


Why are NBA fans the dumbest motherfuckers on the planet, you wrote out all of that just for this bullshit",0
I’ll remember it for decades to come,0
as ant said…he’s been through the worst so the sky is never falling.,2
And I want to see some brotherly fight on screen to,0
"""I think that's a foul""

""I think that's not,""

""Is too!""

""Is not!!""",0
It’s a great line,1
I love how he’s enjoying the moment.,1
..,0
"How you not gonna include mass shooters, they're the ones who do it all the time lmao.",1
"If it’s true, there was a top comment in a different post that said Kyrie was referring to the camera crew in regards to that quote",1
All these posts by usernames with word-word-number,0
And OKC.,0
"Reaves, a low post maestro.",0
"This narrative is incorrect, KD turned the ball over when he got injured which led to a fast break of course the crowd cheered",1
Reddit just ran with the hate train and it took off,2
Now talk about Jokic you racist,0
If that helps you to better cope with the situation,1
Fine he is getting phantom calls not because the game is rigged but because [please insert what you like].,1
"This narrative is incorrect, KD turned the ball over when he got injured which led to a fast break of course the crowd cheered",1
Reddit just ran with the hate train and it took off,2
5/12 from 3 lol,1
"So he didn't miss like a million other shots, had stupid turnovers, and simply wasn't effective offensively while giving dumb passes and not even taking the ball when the team needed him? Why can't we just say he played well today, was decent last game, but was bad in the first 2 instead of saying he was always good?",2
Like Kyrie in the first half of game 1,2
who? you mean bite bite?,2
"There are TikToks of dudes in Compton riding shotgun with an RPG.

Yeah, it's probably fake, but assault weapons are widely proliferated in the states",2
It's not exactly beyond the pale.,2
"Get in the car, loser.",0
"We would be hearing about his mentality blah blah, the ant dick riding is getting outta hand.",0
Luka feeds off of those boos,0
The crowd should actually cheer for him,0
BS call,0
Yep this series goes to 6 or 7 and either team is getting destroyed by the Celtics most likely,1
"I agree with this post, Minni will at least get one more",1
"It is highly unlikely but if they pull 4-3, I won’t be completely shocked.",2
"It absolutely is, in fact the league used Luka himself as an example of when that should be an offensive foul.

https://x.com/NBAOfficial/status/1443591620901761040",1
Have you considered that the Celtics just best Dallas in the finals without an injury? 🙄 This sub I swear.,1
"Every team he was on, except for the Mavs, loves this dude",0
He was an incredibly exciting player for the Boston Celtics,1
"After his falling out with the Mavs he became an incredible vet on teams like the Pelicans, Kings, Bulls, and Lakers, mentoring younger guys with his basketball IQ and work ethic",1
He wasn't a very agreeable character but he was very passionate and anyone who actually followed his career knows that.,1
"> He just got axed because people got tired of losing.

The fans seemed fine with it as long as they got something real out of The Process; it seemed like it was the league office and the other owners who had the problem.",1
"Kendrick Perkins, blocked by Gobert!",0
"Ant hasn't been driving to the rim cos Dallas holding him to like 36% or something, he playing scared and either passing or settling for contested middies",0
"There was a stretch in the 3rd quarter where he passed up 3 clean looks in a row to pass it to an objectively worse shooter too, he ain't MJ",2
Adding Boogie to pair with AD,0
"I was shocked and excited, but like all good Pels teams, the injury bug hit a star player when we needed him most.",1
Almost as if everyone like to exaggerate things to prove their biased opinions,0
Everyone is guilty!,0
Damn they really needed Kyrie and Luka to shoot this badly to win,1
Not likely this team but I just thought it was so funny how the Wolves commentators were making me feel like the game was going out of hand with those turnovers and those KAT offensive fouls and yet they keep holding on to that 1 pt lead in spite of it all,2
It just feels like a roller coaster of emotions for Wolves fans,0
Need the personnel for that,0
This Arenas guy is mad bum lmao what is his legacy in NBA ? He was average at best,1
Jordan then took that personally and never lost three straight games again (until maybe with the Wizards).,1
and ppl are right,1
"Ant has sucked shit this entire series, this game included outside of the first quarter.",2
Isn't it all part of the lore and history of the game?   Without such meaningless bantering and pettiness people will just go on to the next entertaing thing,2
The mickey mouse ring is likely to be remembered more than the last title Kobe won.,1
True,1
Good skin but an ugly face,2
"Still has sex with beautiful women whenever he wants, so I’m sure he doesn’t care.",1
People are acting like the Celtics have been at full strength all playoffs.,1
Gobert with the great perimeter defending,1
Just as foretold.,0
Ugh here comes the Ant glazing again,0
It was KAT who got them back in this game and Gobert who kept the other games close,2
"Ant has done all the chirping, but not a lot else yet",0
There are no asterisks,0
You can objectively say their run so far is relatively easy but that doesn't mean it's an asterisk it's just reality.,1
And everything was all ASS.,0
Was this your first nba basketball game you've ever watched ever?,2
"Luka was shooting front on, the new rule was shooting sideways",1
Impossible,2
Perhaps the archives are incomplete.,0
Thank you Rudy Gobert,0
Context matter,0
I was talking about the defensive play from Irving on Reid and not about any stat sheet numbers,0
So there is nothing wrong with what I said,2
Irving partially blocked it but Reid still made the bucket,0
"If you never heard about partially blocking a rim runner, than this is not my problem.",0
Like dick dick?,0
iPhone users too lazy to login to their computer Reddit account lmao (guilty),2
Quite literally,0
Did you see that vid of him diving for the loose ball??,2
Is this the new “don’t let us get one” 🤔,1
"I’ve spent years trying to craft the perfect take foul 3 point and 1, plus double tech, flagrant 2, then another 3 and 1 after the ball is given back, possession on 2K",1
I’m going insane.,2
"guess your opinion has changed?


Presti is not infallible",0
Reggie is awful man.,2
like you can pick any game he's ever called and I could give you at least 4 instances of him just saying something completely false about what's happening on the floor and he never corrects himself,2
"I have liked Jamal Crawford since he's been in Reggie's unit, he corrects him a decent bit",1
they always play rusty.,0
Rubio will drop 60 on them,0
What’s funny about it? They’re gonna get it,1
Dred Dan Vleet,0
is he really though?,1
was it a win?,1
"Yeah maybe but you could argue that if Luka and especially Kyrie were playing like they were before today, it would be over",0
Me when my friend doesn't accept the queue,0
kat nofear at all.,0
hes gonna shoot no matter what..,0
You should get your head checked for real,1
First half is the worst one from both teams in the series.,2
"Last season, Luka and Kyrie didn't make the playoffs",0
"Pipe down, buddy.",2
You can’t see if he is even touching the forearm or not as the picture has only two digit pixels,1
"Looks all ball in the replay and if they don’t give another angle, I‘ll stay with the non call until L2M says otherwise.",0
I'm a fan of another team and I would love the 76ers to max Jimmy Butler.,1
And still 3 bad Edwards passes away from winning the first two games.,2
Minnesota has played its best when theyre having fun this a good sign imo,1
Losing JVG is worse than losing Inside The NBA to me,2
I love Inside but I mainly just want to watch games and JVG was the only guy saying things that I haven't heard a million times watching basketball,1
"Yeah, it's ridiculous",2
"Unfortunately, social media is just rife with misinformation & it's too easy to block & cut yourself off from conflicting information",1
"And mainstream media just reinforces all of it for the sake of ""fairness & balance,"" so we're stuck with people who've never been to Washington thinking Seattle is some kind of lawless void.",1
We all lost 30 IQ points reading this post.,0
That’s a foul,2
Cry about it if you want but that’s a foul,2
Him and Dloe it makes sense that there best friends,1
I'd heard that Stan and Jeff were featured on fewer broadcasts this season because the NBA didn't like the look of commentators complaining about the product on TV,0
"Understand where they're coming from as the league tries to secure their biggest TV contract ever, but man I miss them calling it like it is when it's not good",1
This feels like a crisp breath of fresh air.,1
You underestimate the power of Naz Reid,0
And as a Raptors fan I can tell you that Jimmy was the one guy that scared the crap out of me the whole series,2
The only reason we needed that buzzer beater in the first place is because Butler had a great play on the other end to tie it,1
We could sorta contain Embiid with Gasol in the game but we didn't have an answer for Jimmy.,2
"Brain damage, probably.",0
Rest in peace Mac Dre,0
Usually? Are you sure its not all the time?,1
Then they drop the first game at home after not playing anyone decent for 8 weeks.,2
"Iirc correctly, he was a +2 in 13 minutes",0
"He's obviously not back to full strength, but he can be valuable to get the main rotation bigs some rest without being a complete liability.",1
"The nuggets played the 8th, 4th, 7th, and 8th seeds, including that exact finals scenario you described",1
that wouldn’t even be the easiest championship in the last two years lol,1
Unless you're Luka.,0
He was averaging 22/8/8 into tonight,0
If KAT made even one more 3 per game this is 3-1 (and he'd still be below his average 3P%),2
The process is a failure.,2
It was not best of 7 tho,1
I think people underrate adrenaline,0
Low T,0
I’m one of those people,0
Haven’t really payed attention to T wolves since the KG because well.,2
"it’s the Timberwolves..

Everyone in Minnesota is clamoring about how we have a championship caliber team.",0
so I decide I’m going to tune in and enjoy some basketball again,1
And immediately am reminded why I don’t bother watching anymore.,0
"I feel like I understand fouls at a basic level, like there are some definite defined obvious fouls that happen all the time in every game.",2
"what I don’t understand is the majority of calls, as in like 75% of the fouls I see that get called seems like it is purely subjective based on whoever the ref is.

They almost NEVER show a replay of a foul which I find really fucking weird.",2
how much effort would it take to have a dedicated group of people to show a little side screen(not even taking time away from gameplay) to just quickly show the viewers exactly why it was a foul?  It’s so frustrating and dumb that I don’t even care what happens.,2
it literally is up to the discretion of the refs on who will win or lose a game.,1
"they legit have that much power over these fouls that if they want, they can easily give a certain team like a 90% chance of winning based on the fouls they give out",1
"There isn’t anyway to overcome it.

Does anyone get what I’m saying?  Like half the fucking game is fouls and we don’t even get to see whatever the fuck that is.",2
ever,0
It’s just pointless to invest interest and energy into something that is this volatile.,2
People already forgot about that sadly,2
"Simmons is a headcase and injured a bunch but he was all NBA and all defense, you can't call that a miss",0
The rest yeah those dudes were all either at best bench guys or fringe players.,1
ATP he has pretty much shit talked every team he has been apart of,1
One day he’ll realize maybe it’s not the teams.,0
"Next time he should elbow the guy, just to make sure there is real foul and not whatever this bs call was.",1
"""Don't waste our verbal assaults on the refs, thats my job"" - Luka",0
"if you’re saying the word “incel”, you *do* have some clue about what he is talking about",0
no need do be ashamed.,0
That's actually a pretty solid comp,1
"What's there to not understand? PJ > Jokic, easy.",1
"Yeah, it's like any stat where it's like ""X averages Y when their team wins""",1
Yeah..,0
"No shit that if you take out all the games you lose, your stats are better.",1
Some would say the only scenario,0
"To be fair Ant is missing shots because of how the Mavs are playing him, he is being funneled toward a shot blocker and has been blocked enough that now he is hesitant to finish his drives and is settling for a lot of contested mid range shots which are the least efficient shot in basketball",1
"If he doesn't settle he is passing out, hence inflating his assist numbers the last couple games, but also his turnovers as when he gets funneled a help defender comes and Mavs have been semi reliably forcing turnovers in this situation, but Ant has been scared to attack strong and when he has he has been held far under his regular numbers because Mavs always have an above average shot blocker on the floor.

Edit: whereas Luka and Kyrie are getting the looks they like, just missing",1
"It’s not rigged it’s just consistently awful lol, hurts the Wolves especially because we’re a defense first team whose stars don’t tend to generate calls the same way a Luka or an SGA does

When the officiating is that bad all the time it feels rigged against everyone",2
ain't no way he's only lost 3 series in his entire career.,0
NBACJ is NBA's father,0
Fiind out! On the next episooode of DRAGON BALLL ZEEEEE,0
I think it's Ed Malloy? Lol,1
Milwaukee sub “fans” are also doomers… still unsure what the point of your comment was,2
Luka is the reason,0
"I really think that Mavs were lucky to have Lively for the first three games, because without him they´ll have it extra complicated to win a game",1
"Literally every other East team besides maybe the Magic had multiple key players (including stars/superstars) out, hobbled, or both.

And to be fair to the Celtics, no Porzingus for the last two rounds.",1
He what?,0
uhh 25 points at 70% from the field is “okay” to you?,1
Did you know you’re the first person to say this?,1
Kyrie's amazing,1
You just have to deal with it bud,0
Boost up stay safe.,1
The East was injured to hell and Boston was affected too,0
Hard to judge with every team having key players out,2
"That would end Lebron James' career, so I'm all for it",0
As a Mavs fan I would accept losing this series if they would fix the messy officiating.,2
If they take CP3 and change we will.,0
I mean he dropped multiple passes in the first half,2
But then he came out and played amazing in the second half.,1
Yeah they supposedly stopped allowing that a couple years ago,0
It was James Harden's specialty,0
I noticed it too in game 3 especially.,2
Yeah I just referring to a few out of character ones on Luka that Gobert had today,2
"He nearly fouled out but yes it’s a KAT problem, not really Gobert",2
least sensitive mavs fan,2
I love abortions,1
not everyone can be perfect babe,1
"!remindme 6 days

Honestly you are probably right but I'll look like such a badass if we come back lol",1
Good games so far,1
Theres also 15 seven game series every year in the nba compared to 3 in mlb.,2
The desire to throw money at young stars in this league is ridiculous,2
"Giving a man without a jumper, and I’m not talking a Russel Westbrook or Rondo jumper, I mean literally a 24rating in 2k a max, makes 0 sense",2
"Then they decided to play musical chairs with the coaches, getting James Harden just a whole lot of nonsense.",1
Yeahhh I like watching the world series but otherwise I just can't really get into baseball and I really don't have the bandwidth to be super invested in another sport,1
Kinda wish NBA started around Christmas and playoffs around August but that will never happen,0
"4 NBA teams have won 3 in a row only to lose in game 7… think it’s more possible now than ever before because of the nature of 3 point shooting…

NHL has had it happen 4 times MLB just the once",1
What if the trainer pulled the refs wife out to mid-court with a knife against her throat while leaving a trail of pre-cum?,0
"LFG, TATUM VS VINI!",0
not allowed by dray,0
Stealing this for next year when he makes the WCF again  or wins the dunk contest,1
Poison dart frog,0
You're looking at stats not the games...,0
Are these just bots posting this every hour now?,0
"Naz Reid this season 13.5 PPG, 5.2 RPG, 1.3 APG on 47/41/74 splits",0
"Naz Reid this series 17.3 PPG, 3.3 RPG, 1.3 APG on 56/55/65 splits.

Naz Reid is a major statistical anomaly and should be studied",1
"9% better from the field, 14% better from 3",1
"If he performed at his statistical averages yall would already be in cancun

Edit: No point bringing up entire playoff stats as Naz Reid didn't play the Mavs in the last 2 series, so lets keep it about how he is performing in this series, in which he is far better than he was in the regular season.",1
"Luka is banged up, he’s one bad step away from an injury that forces him to miss time or be much less effective.

Game 5 is a must-win for Dallas.",1
Personally I never saw it working,0
"Hayward has been a solid player for a long time, but he's past his best and didn't really fit what the Thunder needed",1
"I took it that they knew they needed more, but they couldn't find a perfect solution, so they went with the best they could and hoped it would work",1
"They didn't have much to lose by making the trade, but if he added some size and rebounding it might have proven the edge in a big game.",2
">It’s so bizarre he seemed like he finally realized in the first two series his skill is shooting and he just immediately reverts to what makes him a liability

Are you not watching ESPN and TNT?
Shaq and Perk think KAT needs to live in the paint and drive and post up.

I swear these people don't actually watch games other when they're doing them - and even then, questionable if they understand what's doing on.",1
"lol such an underrated comment, this will for sure be buried since the thread is old",1
But I’m going to be calling Edwards “al gaib” from this point forward,0
"To be fair, a large percentage of refs you suck chants are just salty fans, not bad calls",1
on the arm,0
"you can't see it on the live feed, but it's very clear on the replay: [https://streamable.com/nntsqa](https://streamable.com/nntsqa)",1
If I was a kings fans I'd probably be in this thread coping also I get it,0
Kobe had tantrums in practice lol,1
Dude you are just saying things completely unaware.,0
lol that’s literally the point I’m making,1
"Our stars played poorly in games 1-3 and we still lost by a combined 13 points 

Relax",2
Okay,1
Maybe not to you lol,1
He's definitely doing alright.  Ants got a great career ahead of him so long as he stays focused on it.,1
scriptwriters putting layers in this shit,2
"Doncic on his way down the Embiid/Shai path, like that other thread/comment the other day, eventually NBA fans will turn and hate on the guys they like now.",2
Except when you're Stephen curry,0
I don’t think you know what an asterisk is supposed to signify,0
Do you have a link to the original? That makes no sense to be honest.,1
I do watch,0
Lively is their starting center and Gafford is their backup,1
Always a center with fresh legs guarding the paint,1
"In this game, they have Powell as their backup",2
"In addition to being their rim protector on defense,  he is a lob threat on offense",0
The guy hasnt freakin missed a single field goal in this series,2
You take away that and the offense dramatically changes for the Mavs,1
"I don’t know man, he’s pretty good",1
Embiid is injured every year,0
That’s like saying the Clippers are championship contenders when healthy 😂 for 5 years in a row.,1
He's playing for a spot at the ship,0
Lakers are nowhere to be seen,0
🤣,0
This game had an all time duo of Scott Foster and Ed Malloy,2
You had to know it was going to be amazing from start to finish.,1
find me someone outside of TNT headquarters who thinks Draymond is the next Chuck,0
"Like let's be so fr, even Warriors fans admit he's annoying as shit",2
"> It’s like they knew gobert was out and Ant just funnels to him normally so they just destroyed him to the paint like 8 plays in a row it was crazy.

Kyrie literally said ""when Gobert was out, lane opened up and we drove it"".",2
Harden has been a spectator in any game that’s mattered .,2
Hall of fame playoff dropper,0
So wonder will he be 14:4 in the end of this series? :D I doubt it.,0
Since MJ retired,0
"(The 2nd time, not the first or third)",0
"KAT got fouled on Gafford’s clutch block in game 3, and SVG went off on him for like 2 minutes to stop complaining",2
"Yeah, Draymonds presence has just made it toxic as hell",0
I want the wolves to come back so Rudy can do the Post Game interview after g7 and watch Draymond mald lol,1
Lmao wtf,1
No way the situations are the same,0
Ja fucked up his own career with that fake G shit off the court.,2
Healthy Sixers are better than the Knicks.,1
Top 2% in Canada which includes some of the poorest towns in the country,1
"That’s is very different from living in a HCOL area like Vancouver where the average salary for an experienced worker is 130k/year, and average home price is 1.2million",1
"Even on offense - the screens are, at least, noticable.

But there are numerous instances in the game when a Wolves player is driving the lane and Gobert is preventing help from coming by blocking them and putting his body between the defenders and the driving player.

(I mean, don't get me wrong, he's got stone hands and just isn't an offensive juggernaut - but noone expected him to be one)

TLDR: Fuck Draymod",2
Fuck Shaq,2
"Fuck Perk.

I started out this series rooting for the Mavs (neutral really), but the amount of bullying and hate Gobert got from these casual shitter pundits made my root for him.

Problem is, the casual NBA viewers drink up this horse shit from SAS, Shaq, Draymond, etc - and the vast majority of these fans think ridiculing Gobert is 100% spot on.",2
"As you wrote that, Ant just guaranteed a game 8",2
I like Luka but damn he cries a lot,1
soft,1
They’ve called moving screens so many times in these playoffs.,1
the Hayward trade was actually a covert 200IQ move by Presti to make Giddey look better by comparison,1
that's not even remotely true,1
i woujldn't even  say he's top 5,1
You'll have plenty of time to devote to your crusade after Game 5.,2
"tbf your teams fans brigade the ever loving fuck out of every team sub that they play - more than any other team i've ever seen, so it probably comes from how aggro the luka fanbase is",1
I don’t hate him but I can see how someone can dislike him for knocking up a girl and telling her to get an abortion,2
same can be said for kyrie this game he played extra bad,2
couldn't hit anything and had a very bad TO,2
was nearly invisible on the court.,2
He does do this actually lol,1
They deserve to be there,0
tbf I think they excused Foster from this rule change since he has made this awful call more times and longer than any other ref,2
Harden and Foster were the most dynamic duo in NBA history.,1
We did it pretty well with the reigning COTY,1
Okc first round exit next year,2
Send Da OnlyFans,0
So much gawk gawk you forgot about 2012,1
"You haven't seen even a good Luka game yet, you forget he put up a 73 point game this year? You also remember he had a 33/6/8 game the other day and many people called that the worst game of his playoff career, that wasn't an exaggeration, his worst playoff game is on par with either Ant or KAT best playoff game, today he had a dogshit Luka playoff game and still had a near 30 point triple double with a game high 15 rebounds",2
Levels,0
Kat played how he should've and he got crazy praise for game 7 as if he was game 6 Klay,2
The expectations for him are really low lol,1
Healthier team wins nba championships,1
Luka is 100x worse than SGA,2
He was ass in round 1,2
Biggest bitch in the league,0
Yea but McDaniels gets fouled at the end of the game and the other team even had a challenge so even if the ref was wrong it wouldn’t affected the game,2
Yet they swallowed the whistle and all the refs can choke on my nuts,0
Luka gets a foul literally any time someone reaches yet still crys like a little girl.,2
He is correct and dudes have made careers off that trash call.,0
That's nuts,0
This guy is one hell of a player.,0
"I said game threads, not post-game threads.

These were comment through the first and second quarter or before halftime way before the hack-a-Lively every single game",2
That’s the whole story,1
Also Tbf adding on game 1 the Mavs were down a lot in FT and I would have complained if I were you guys too,2
But after that it was crazy.,2
Butler is more valuable to the Heat than any picks,1
That's not the point of the above commenter,0
It was said the 76ers have no assets and that isn't accurate,2
That is all.,0
"It would extend our window.

I want to keep Jimmy, getting another star back is the only way I would be ok with it.",1
Boston can be legitimate champions and at the same time have one of the easiest routes to the Finals in NBA history,0
Both can be true and there’s nothing wrong with that,2
No asterisk.,0
Cant penetrate from the 3 point line when you have picked up your dribble.,0
Keep an eye out for Ben Taylor,0
"He’s doing big things, really giving refs fans hope after those two retire",1
Holy shit we got the actual victory and the moral victory at the same time,2
"I like the way he plays pissed, reminds me of other players etc......but my god, please stfu about calls for 5min just one time in a game.",2
Small ball is the truth,2
They gave us 2 ECF MVPs,0
"Jamal was cooking and up 20 in the closeout game and still lost, wym",2
KAT will be long gone bg then,2
"That would be great! Minnesota should be playing our natural rivals(chicago, Milwaukee, Detroit, Cleveland)",1
"And, if there is justice in basketball, by the end of the series he'll be 14-4: not a bad record!",2

Yes,0

0 guarantee y’all are winning game 7 with tatum but sure,1
"yea, this bad call has existed for so long and it was strange to see it be called so badly in an elimination game",2
Swear I've been loudly stating to my TV the same logic you wrote for 20 seasons.,1
You have to be dumb to understand it.,2
Yes,0
They are a Lakers fan,0
Of course they do,0
"He was such a cool guy, lucky to have him as a blazer",1
Butler is more valuable to the Heat than those picks are,1
That in it of itself is not true,2
Marcus Smart Has been targeted by bigs,1
Jaren Jackson in a similar manner in which Rudy has been targeted,0
Giannis as well,0
"Heck, even Draymond",0
The only reason Rudy is spotlighted is because of how many times he’s won DPOY,1
Players win DPOY because of their impact on the defensive side of the floor,1
Rudy’s impact to the wolves defense has been significantly more positive than negative,1
Just because he’s on more highlights doesn’t mean the wolves are performing worse with him on the floor,1
"If anything, the evidence backs it up that the wolves are in deed much worse with him on the bench.",2
Regardless meaning win or lose,1
He’s still himself and he’s always been that way,0
I’m sorry you couldn’t figure that out,2
/:,0
Swapping Butler for Mitchell doesn't make us contenders,0
And you beat no one,0
Your best win was an injured Pacers,1
We might finally get him this year,0
He's work out at a free agent camp with us again,1
"I mean if the Wolves pull off the reverse sweep, by historical precedent, we can say they will sweep for the championship series.",2
"sick pass, carried and travelled tho",2
"God **fuck** Celtics fans honestly.

Your team can lose *anybody* and be the best team in the east still",1
I'm so sorry nobody is sucking your dick more about sweeping the ECF against a team that won 35 games last year and is missing their key superstar bro u have it so hard,2
You're crying about him admitting they had injury lucky in their earlier rounds dude,1
Could you genuinely lack any more self awareness?,1
"Regular season means nothing you are in for a reality check, better hope Zingis is healthy you will need him",1
He turned over the ball in some stupid situations but if KAT showed up at all G1-2 none of them would have been individually game-losing mistakes.,2
I expect the Mavs win game 5 and put an end to this type of nonsense.,1
i was taken back in time when he made that call,0
Been watching him make that garbage call for so long.,2
He's in Space Jam..,0
"Regardless of what? That seems like a very incomplete sentence that almost ended in ""regardless of how negative your qualities are.""",2
Cowboys are just bad luck,2
Leave the Mavs and Stars alone,0
Mahomes needs to show up at the games if those Cowboys do,0
Flash those rings.,0
Hey homie keep rooting for the Mavs plz thank you,0
"No the asterisk is because the Nets gave them the assets to have 4 of their 5 current starters for literal dog shit

"Probably, but nobody is going to admit to anything until they're all retired",0
"nah see that doesnt accomplish what we want here which is to tell someone who thinks there are medical benefits to ""sweating out toxins"" that that's not true",2
"Dude is old and injury prone, however team gives him a extension (even more so a max extension), that will be a obvious mistake",1
Sad he had some good looks on those 3s,1
"if Luka and Kyrie play the series no asterisk, if they miss most of it its fair game, because the mickey mouse road would get even worse, all that matters is the team gets challenged in the finals.",1
You’re a dedicated fan though (based on that); you aren’t really who the league should be worried about,2
"You can’t fill stadiums every game with all dedicated fans, there aren’t enough",2
"You need casuals to make money, and this type of buffoon ref behavior turns casuals off.",0
That's what I mean,2
I wouldn't be surprised if Chicago asks for more or says yes,1
He should be at least a young player or two  and the 10 or straight up Lauri but that would be an overpay,1
No DPOY is getting matchup hunted either so dont see the point of this argument.,0
"He's averaged a near triple double for the series, surprisingly",1
Just wish it were coming with less boneheaded turnovers,2
"Every time I think about that series, I smile",1
Corny is calling Minnesota Minny,0
He was simply acting as Luka's emissary.,0
"Seek help brother, your post history is obsessing with Bron",0
Honestly I'm shocked He got a nickname thats not rated R.,2
We don’t write the rules,0
Let Timberwolves believe it,0
Every team wants to believe when they are down.,2
Is the Timberwolves path the easiest in NBA history???,0
"If Boston takes it, no one will remember the East being the weaker conference",0
A title is historic no matter what.,0
"The Mavs have also been playing pretty poorly by their standards, they had the best record and defense in the league over the last 20 or so games of the season",1
They have a severly hobbled Luka who is still cooking yall at 50% strength,0
"You could easily say if Kyrie and Luka play at their statistical averages they will cook the Timberwolves too, so it goes both ways",1
"Except that the Mavs have the players to stop Ant doing what he likes to do, which is why he isn't hitting his statistical averages, that won't change in game 5",2
Expect Ant to hit the over on assists and turnovers in game 5 and the under in points and efficiency,0
"He is being funneled to the paint where a shot blocker who doesn't foul is waiting for him, so he is passing out or taking contested mid ranges instead of finishing like he usually would",2
If he hesitates and isn't decisive the help defender is picking his pocket,2
"Mavs will live with KAT cooking them from outside, because he is streaky and also wont punish them inside which makes it easier to defend the paint",1
Edit: all of that also fails to account for Luka having never lost a series he is leading and Kyrie never losing a series after winning 3 games and both of them having a history of clutch performances in the playoffs while nobody on the Wolves has much experience or history of clutch performances in the playoffs,1
"In fact Conley just won his first conference final game having previously been swept in conference finals, just like the timberwolves were last time they made it this far",1
literally changing the game.,2
"Second cousins, ya?!",0
if I see your bum ass celebrating a mavs chip you need to delete your account.,0
Absolutely,1
He’s still an efficient 25/5/5 guy,0
He’s worth more than just 10 and salary.,1
Or if you're the Astros.,0
Everyone just likes to build narratives,0
It is just what it is with the current social media and generation,1
Injuries will always happen especially how fast pace and even the amount of talent the end of bench players has,1
"Players are much stronger, faster nowadays",0
"People are talking about how easy the East is, it’s because of injuries",1
"Boston themselves played a total of 20 games last playoffs without even making the finals, but no one was talking about it.",0

Its been insane to watch luka and kyrie play too.,2
Horrible call,2
He landed so it’s essentially Luka just bumped into a player just standing in front of of him,0

He said him and Bryan Forbes were on the bench talking about where they’re gonna go on vacation during game 3 when bucks were down 0-2 to the nets 🤣🤣🤣,2
Refs reviewing to add time back on the clock when it's impossible to make a comeback is wild,1
Any bets that needed to be covered or something? Made me chuckle thinking if they pulled this nonsense back during the 97 finals,0
Gotta eject all the people that ran on the court to celebrate and sweep all the confetti off the court,0
Jazz gotta inbound with <1s left on the clock and Bulls leading by 4,0
Just gotta get a 4-point play so only ludicrously improbable!,2

* In 2015 they messed up and drafted Okafor instead of Porzingis",1
"* Are you going to tell me they wouldn't have won more games during the 15-16 season if Embiid & Porzingis were healthy and played for that Sixers team?  



* This team that was apparently tanking so egregiously that
   * they didn't have the worst record in 2013-14",2
* Had Embiid sit out and still wasn't the worst team in 2014-15,2
* So after just a single season of having the worst record the NBA stepped in,2
That single-season which never would have happened if they had better health and just made better decisions in the draft,1
The 76ers got punished for having an unhealthy Embiid and making other bad draft decisions,2
In the same way other teams did not get punished.,2
until now lol,1

The way they'd do that is they (kyrie or Luka) drive past their defender with no issues which causes Gobert to step up,2
They then lob it to Lively or Gafford,1
I'm not sure how Gobert is supposed to defend essentially a 2v1,2
Wanna know who has caused this scenario the most? Anthony Edwards,1
While also being non-existent first 2 games,1
Ant and Kat were much were this series than Gobert,1
Kat was historically bad until tonight,2
"Also just to rebute that stat, they shot 55% at the rim with Rudy on the floor and were 14/14 when he was off for the first 2 games",1
You don't even know what you're talking about haha,1
"100%

There was a proposal to re-seed east and west mixed together based off overall record",1
Was seriously considered but then travel time caused a longer schedule that didn’t fly with owners,2
Ethical ball is goated itself so hes the goat of goatedness.,0
A living disappointment.,2
Naz Reid.,0
KG would be hyped watching his boys clash in the finals,0
Source: Twolves fans,0
kyrie jus needs ti not do what he did today for 3 more games in a row,1
KAT’s dad is at every game,2
Its probably that KATs mom died relatively recently while Ant has had years to cope with his loss,0
Luka was pretty bad too.,2
Man we are hard as fuck to beat when refs let the players play physical and don't fall for obvious foul bait,2
Problem is the refs have gotten *softer* in the playoffs this year for some god forsaken reason,0
A disappointment,2
I think about that series way too much.,1
I’m biased but last year was really the year,1
"My man, your team played better without you.",1
They had to go by the rules.,0
Agreed,0
The Thunder music video commercial is pretty bad too.,2
Well they'll get the Wolves and Pelicans in like 4-5 years,0
His nickname will be Deadly D.,2
And a disappointment,2
WAaaaaaayyyy too many injuries to say this,1
"> DDV 

who is this?? Demar DeVrozen?",0
Kyries played terrible,2
If he puts up 20+ y'all are eliminated,0
Relax,0
Looks a lot like Luka's already in his upward shooting motion,0
"To be fair, it's because the Mavs are a much better team too",1
"They had the best record in the league over the last I think 20 games or so, can't remember precisely how many, but also the best defense in the league by a good margin in that span too",1
They came into form at the right time and are a lot better than their record as much of their improvement was due to great trade deadline acquisitions,1
If you stretched their end of season record out over the whole season they would of had easily the best record in the league,1
Fixed all their weaknesses while adding extra firepower,1
"The fact they can always have a starter level rim protector on the floor is massive come playoffs and a big part of why Ant has not been finishing his drives and instead opting for contested mid range shots or passing out, which has inflated his assist numbers but also driven his turnover numbers up because he is being forced to do things he doesn't like to do.",2
Why would you expect more from a Lakers fan? They're all nephews.,1
And pathetic,2
Injuries were crazy this year,2
Guessing it'll balance out some before long.,2
and 6'2,0
He probably had one stashed,0
Guy I knew in highschool that was in a gang had a few guns stashed in random places in case shit went down.,2
lol love the comments going full opioid epidemic,1
"I mean, East is really injured",2
"They played the first round without Jimmy, the second round Mitchell got injured after game 3, in the CF Haliburton got injured after game 2",2
All the games were decently close except the Heat series despite Heat taking one game off them,2
"Celtics themselves missing KP, their starter who is injured as well.

Even if Knicks won Pacers, they have 3 impactful players who are injured as well",2
It’s just unlucky overall,1
"For Bucks, Giannis was out for the whole series",1
"Last season, Boston played 2 game 7 series and 1 game 6, but people weren’t talking about it",2
"For the amount of people saying West is the better and harder conference, there were a lot more sweep or gentleman sweep in the West.

The Heat had to go through Bucks, Knicks and Celtics to get to the finals last season, by the time they got there, they were spent because of how dominating the Nuggets were and how easy it was in the West.",1
And sad,2
"As a Mavs fan, don't think this should've been a foul",2
But iirc I think this might be a landing-rule foul a la Zaza Pachulia,2
"The only reason why I wouldn't fully agree with it would be because if you look at the play, Luka has no room to shoot after the pump other than to go straight into KAT's face and potentially risk a dangerous landing.

This series has been real weird in terms of foul calls if I'm being honest",2
I still feel like Minnesota fouls the shit out of Dallas (I remember a play where Ant straight-up hugged Kyrie during the entire possession),1
"At the same time, we're getting soft fouls like this",1
I just want consistency but I guess you can't have that in this league.,0
"Are there reasonably paid jobs available to all young people Asian, Arab and caucasian ?",1
should we tell bella hadid,0
and large penised,1
Wow what a badass /s,1
"Sure, twist my words lol I agree that Luka flops sometimes",1
Tons of players flop,0
No one likes it,0
Luka gets way more hate than her deserves,2
Rudy by a mile has been a bigger bitch than Luka this series,0
As well as KAT.,0
He not gon reply to this one neph,0
luka is godly skilled but tough to watch with all the flopping and complaining,1
"You have the most freethrows taken in the post season, when you remove garbage time and intentional fouls you have the most FTA per game, the amount of foul trouble the best defenders on LAC, OKC, and MIN are every game is crazy, and again Luka averaging 2 fouls a game with what he does is absurd considering the fouls he's drawing on people and how often he gets targeted.",2
And pathetic,2
There are betting implications,0
"I know nobody gives a fuck about other people's bets, but I had taken Dallas/Under 51 for the 4th Q..",2
"but I also threw a few bucks on Tie/Over 51 just in case (because 4th Qs somewhat ""frequently"" end in ties, especially in big games) because the odds are big enough that a couple bucks won me all my money back",2
"It was a 27-27 tie in the 4th, but if there's enough time to get a shot off, if the league wants to be in bed with sportsbooks..",1
"it's only fair that people that took Dallas to win the 4th Q got a fair chance.

There's also the game total, team totals, player props etc.

Again, I never talk sports betting in sports subs because nobody wants to hear it, just giving a reason why it matters",1
"The league wants to be partners with sportsbooks, they can't really just decide not to play a fraction of the game",2
"Well they can, but it could potentially give sports talk shows something negative to talk about

It probably also comes up in reffing grades",2
"""You decided to bleed half a sec off the clock"", they are professionals",2
"If enough off-ball fouls happened during a tip-in, it could have happened",0
"I have a legitimate five-point play, and it doesn't require any referee to call more than a single foul",1
"It doesn't even require a 3-pointer.

If at 0.2 seconds someone tipped the ball, leading to a made two-pointer, and three other offensive players were fouled between 0.2 seconds and the final buzzer, and each of these three players made their free throw, that would make a 5-point play.",1
"I feel like we commit so many stupid fouls that either (a) the refs assume we're gonna keep being stupid so they call a bunch of phantom shit, (b) the stupid is contagious and the refs catch it, or (c) both",2
It's crazy how many people here just straight up don't know the rules,1
Mike ConLeBronny...?,0
What about the van gundy cousins,0
Just bench all starters game one lol,1
So you’re saying Luka flops because it works and that doesn’t also apply to OKC..how?,0

"You sweat out toxins, just not a significant amount",1
You're welcome,1

bad as you need babe,2
Healthy bucks Knicks and 6ers it would’ve been fine,1
Now they’ll wait til a pivotal moment in the finals and call it again.,0
Fuck boston but this actually work against us no? Every extension takes out the rest that they need.,2
You are a bad person.,2
No they did not,0
They made jumping sideways and backwards into a defender an offensive foul,2
The rule doesn't state anything about jumping forwards or straight up.,1
"Except the techs.

The flop techs they tried ended up making bad decisions worse",2
It just gave refs a way to double down on bad calls,2
"It would turn a 2-3 point swing into 3-4 point swing.

Tatum accidentally undercut Brunson early in the season and we somehow got FTs from it because the referees tried to claim he'd flopped.

Plus the bulk of those weak clapping/waving techs happen in the early season",2
Same with the techs for hanging on the rim to avoid major spinal injuries.,1
White privilege,0
"Or, conversely, the NBA is soft as hell and fans actually enjoy seeing the best athletes in the world play physical",1
Game 2 against the nuggets had old heads reigniting their passion for the NBA,2
"Nobody wants to watch Luka, SGA, Harden, Trae, flop around for 48 minutes foul baiting",2
This is honestly so heartwarming,1
What a legend.,0
No I wouldn't,0
They need to be called,0
Luka is the best player in the world,1
He doesn't have to flop,0
"He does because it works, and he would never get fouls otherwise.",0
Close enough with Lively going down,1
The dropoff from Lively to Powell/Kleber is hugeee,1
Baiting a defender on a pump fake and then jumping into them has always been the lamest shit,2
Getting a defender to bite on a fake already affords the offensive player the opportunity to penetrate,2
They shouldn't also have the choice of getting free throws at will,1
"Defensive players will still foul by over-committing to a fake, but any instance of the offensive player jumping into the defender should be a no-call or offensive foul.",2
"ok good, so a better way to phrase it would be, ""you do sweat out incredibly small amounts of things colloquially considered ""toxic"" (though some of them are essential nutrients like copper and arsenic (probably lead as well)) and something like salt is toxic in certain amounts but necessary in lesser amounts just like the above listed metals so using the word ""toxic"" at all is pretty stupid, but the idea that there is any benefit to ""sweating out toxins"" is complete pseudo science""

See thats pretty long though, im fine with boiling that down to ""you dont sweat out toxins""",1
"Also that Nuggets Lakers series was a close sweep due to bad late game decision making by the Lakers throwing multiple games they should have won, just like how the Pacers should have won 3 of those games but just did dumb shit down the stretch while the Celtics executed things perfectly down the stretch",2
"Or because he is known to do dumb fouls, no benefit of the doubt for him.",2

The players understand this and that's why they are more than content with the 50/50 payment structure they currently have, and why most are very down to earth and humble about their circumstances.

"What if you shot a 3, made it, and then while in mid air the entire team gang tackled you and started kicking the shit out of you.

"You tried to dismiss their views.

No we aren't",0
"I was discussing the Jazz's best path to large-scale, long-term team improvement",1
"Even when it comes to a trade itself the value isn't what the team thinks, it is what they can leverage",0
You aren't hearing how they actually value the player,0
">Sure, and their public communication is that they want a Gobert level haul",1
"4 firsts is less than that.

Which a) is insane if that were true (it's not) and b) is never going to happen c) set a precedent for exactly what NOT to give up in a trade",2
"Gobert was a multiple time All-Star, multiple time defensive player of the year, multiple time All-defense player",0
There is no chance that they get anything close to the Gobert haul.,0
Would of won if you didn't let an 8th seed that barely escaped the play in put you in an 0-3 hole,2
So ridiculous that players never shoot from that distance anymore because of the fucking three point  line,2
This series is so weird as well,2
Like all 4 games are so close and its been very fun overall.,1
Adam Silver is by far the worst thing to happen to the league in the last 20years,2
"I can see his influence in every game, and that is *not* how a commissioner should be viewed",2
"Goodell, as much flak as he gets from NFL fans, you largely don't think of during a game, or even throughout the season.

With Silver, I find myself saying, ""what the fuck?"" a half-dozen times per quarter and wishing he would just spontaneously assimilate with the earth",2
It's why I've stopped watching a vast majority of live games.,1
Exactly what I was looking for!,1
Fuck Draymond,2
He doesn’t because JDub starts there,0
Giddey is listed as a guard and was replaced in the succeeding games as the 2 by Joe.,0
Anytime a Kings flair is bashing Luka I can’t take it seriously for that reason,2
Yeah Luka is fun to watch…,1
But also not at the same time….,0
idk it’s like straight up 50/50 😂😂,1
I think he has it given how much he's fallen in his career,1
Gobert would have gotten an MVP if he could stop Jokic and Luka,0
"No defensive player is going to do that, he's been great fuck the haters.",1
The most upvoted comment on this post says the same exact thing as the comment you're responding to,1
Actually forgot about that,0
Crazy moment.,2
Jazzman,0
"Considering your Lakers lost in 5 in the first round and my Warriors couldn't get passed the play-in, I'd say Western Conference Finals is pretty alright.",1
Don't say big words near kyrie or he'll put a hex on you,1
"And that because Ant yells ""AAY!"" on every drive to the basket they don't call it for him as often",0
Trash talking as long as it’s not racist or dunking on family members should be always welcome,1
"I mean come on, we need intensity and we don’t need opposing players circlejerking each other with praises",2
It can go boring real fast,2
"You can do that after the series is over.

Gobert needs to talk trash too, to doncic to mavs, even to that choking hazard draymond.",0
That's how we went down 2-0,2
We went down 3-0 on some other BS.,2
always,0
Man I had to take my L after clowning on bud hard for that lmao,2
Reports - Elton Brand is beside himself,0
driving around Philly frantically calling and begging(through text) looking for Tobias Harris to re-sign.,2
Much like 2015 GSW who didn't play a single healthy team and got Cavs with LeBron and G leaguers,1
I wouldn't even be mad at that,2
Chris Paul would be amazing at frisbee golf,1
Add in the home court advantage of playing in the Windy City and this could be the start of a dynasty.,0
Best jumper of all time,1
"Its an even better counterpoint to Jimmy, Jimmy saw KAT be amazing in practice and just hated that he wasnt the same player during game time and resented him for it…

Ant saw the same thing, that KAT can be so amazing in game time, so he’s obsessed with bringing it out of KAT rather than resenting KAT for it",1
Jeff can be hilarious though,1
And he is usually does it when the game is slow or boring.,2
"https://imgur.com/a/7psgEaB


There he is hitting mid forearm of his shooting arm.",0
Yeah you either call the stepback a travel (which it often is cause guys do them sloppily) or you go back to the rule change you made at the beginning of the year and then abandoned like a dickwad,0
Then the series starts lol,1
Ok..,1
"""foul"" aside..",0
that is fucking disgusting.,2
Reminds me of that great Jordan clip from The Last Dance,1
“Let's see if all that trash talking starts when it's 0-0 instead of a 5-6 point lead,0
That’s where it starts,0
"That’s the sign of a good man, if he can talk shit when it’s even score",1
Or talk sh*t when you're behind,2
"When you're ahead, it's easy to talk.""",1
But MIN hasn't even been good at home these playoffs,1
Yeah probably an injury to both honestly,1
"I mean, the first two games were decided by 4 points combined",2
"There's like a million things that could have happened.

Series could have started 2-0, 1-1, or 0-2",0
It's kinda nuts.,0
We lost Angel Hernandez today,0
Scott Foster came out with a vintage performance for the fans of the officials today.,0
It's official: ESPN is on reddit.,0
i don't think you know what single handedly means,2
I’ve been saying this all year,0
He can be a legit scoring option if he got the ball more and was more involved in the offense,1
Our offense is too stagnant and involves a lot of Jaden just standing in the corner.,2
Oh absolutely,1
It matters so much,1
There have been a ton of great games and finishes these playoffs but not a ton of game 7's so people dont realize how entertaining this postseason has been.,1
The literal NBA rules clip explain this kind of play uses DONCIC himself as the sample too,1
You can't make this shit up.,2
"I feel like Luka prefers to win on the opposition home court, he seems to play way better away",1
Soft whistles have you so used to flopping you just expect ragdoll physics every time contact is made,1
This is what playing through contact ACTUALLY is,0
Not flailing your arms around like an idiot while still having perfect control to put the ball in the basket.,2
Just let it out dude it’s a safe space,1
"Alternatively, they wouldn't have",0
Prove me wrong.,2
it was also a travel,0
Correct,0
"He won’t even answer me because he knows he’s lying Kat didn’t go straight up that’s the foul right there.

Also KAT had 5 fouls it was just a dumb play by him",2
Got bailed out by Kat's knee,0
These chumps could not score on Lively.,1
"Correlation is not causation.


Are we taking into account his defense slowing down the pace of scoring for the other team as well? Thereby limiting possessions for his own team? 🦥 🦥 🦥",1
Better not be a game 6 😤 My heart can’t take it lol,1
Kyrie wasnt clutch this game tho,2
That turnover at the end was horrendous.,0
Oh you need rental assistance?,0
"Travel as usual with these fancy footwork moves.

He dragged the right pivot foot (can't see from this angle but the replay showed it)",2
"Didn't the Blazers once get eight points in one possession against you guys? Three and one, then Dray complained and got ejected for two, then Kerr complained and got ejected for two.",0
Why is everyone calling him Bradley Beal?,0
"DPOY 

4 total blocks over 4 games 

Opposing center position now at 75%+ FG pct",0
"I loved when he bitched about the refs today with SVG, but besides that...I do like the guy, but he isn't my favorite commentator...",1
Next you’re gonna tell me Sabonis being 10-0 vs AD is meaningless.,2
I've tried to find an objective a way to like Luka,0
"He's a great ball player, but his drama has made this series insufferable.",1
Once KAT is in the air and moving forward it no longer matters if Luka initates the contact or not.,0
The only game 7 he’s ever played in is the 2016 finals,2
So you are saying Kat went straight up?,1
Both teams will be playing Boston though,0
If it were 2-2 we would be talking about how this is an all time great conference final with every game going down to the wire,1
bring ya ass oversaturation cursed us those 1st 3 games we gotta let it die,0
Can you imagine if you had rookie Jordan in that position? You’d be in the finals by now.,0
He’s better than Tatum though that’s not debatable which makes it even funnier coming from a Celtics flair,1
"Well, likely only a few more before they possibly move over to the eastern conference.",1
Why didnt Kyrie just shoot 18-18? Has he thought about not missing shots ever?,0
Nobody is seriously suggesting he will be an MVP candidate,2
Partially blocked on a made bucket might be the biggest cope I've ever seen,0
Just because you got a hand on it doesn't mean it's a block,1
"Stat sheet will tell you that much, it was an attempt and it failed.",2
This,0
This here is what I'm struggling with,0
"Please, Twolves: make history for all of us!",0
How in Gods Green Earth...do they have as much chance as the Celtics did against the Heat....,2
This guy keeps saying this around the subreddit and goes into the Timberwolves subreddit,0
How can you be fuming so hard after a 3-0 lead?,2
"Still better than Tatum bud, go make another hate post can’t wait to watch Celtics choke the finals",2
They gotta get screen time for their sponsor Emirates,0
The patch is there for a reason,0
The NBA wants to feature the refs as side personalities,1
"I mean, if he had stepped up in the previous three games, they may not be on the brink of elimination.",2
Everyone be careful with what they say or Kale Additional will put it on their bulletin board at home,2
"They keep lying to enforce the Luka is a bad defender fake narrative I don’t get why they are so desperate to stick to it.

Hes been lights out defensively all series and had 5 steals a game ago",2
kyrie disappeared hopefully he's back to finish the job next game,2
Never thought id be praying for history alongside an OKC fan,0
‘Overreaction’ 😭😭😭,0
Cool stuff man,1
Love that he was a cyclist,1
Luka takes after Cuban.,0
show me a jaylen brown dirty play comp love to see it,2
Steph would score every point in the game for the Warriors,2
No thank you,0
somehow this review is a testament to lebron's greatness,0
"You watch the whole series or 1 game? Lukas been lockdown defensively the whole series including on Ant, not as easy as “just go at him” he’s not Trae on defense despite the narrative 

He just has 5 steals a game ago and now it’s suddenly switched back to “he plays no D”",2
Mavs r COOKED,0
I’m curious what McDaniels can do as a passer because if he could be a screen and short role play maker that could really open up the offense,1
"Leave Rudy in the dunkers spot, KAT and Conley spacing, could really free up the court for and decision making for Ant",1
I haven’t watched enough Twolves games to know if McDaniels has that slashing/passing ability though,2
He's like Charles Barkley but less loveable,2
Holds up spork,0
"After this amount of failed seasons from the process, I wouldn't be surprised if he jumped ship",2
Despite what I might say during a game Luka is 10x more fun to watch than Embiid.,1
Thats some Southern ass nicknaming right there lmao,1
"Fact of the matter is, you can try to be bad all you want, but it's all about luck",2
"Hawks were a Play-In team but lucked into the 1st pick (albeit in the 2024 draft, but what if this was the Wemby draft?)

As a Bulls fan, we had the worst coach in the league, abysmal point guard play, Justin Holiday taking a million shots, Denzel Valentine minutes, sitting out a good vet in RoLo for tanking purposes (until Adam Silver mandated that we had to play him), going 27-55 in the Luka draft, going 22-60 in the Zion draft, and yet after all of that, we were picking 7th lmao",2
"I've seen every game, and haven't seen luka nearly injure anyone",2
Lmk when he knees someone in the head like kat,0
At least harden kinda draws some sort of contact.,2
"not sure why they called this one, makes zero sense",2
"In real time I couldn’t tell, but watching the replay this is complete bullshit",1
"Also, Luka needs to just - focus",0
On,0
The,0
Game,2
"Quit foul baiting and bitching so much, probably would have won tonight but he care more about whining than balling.",1
He most definitely did lunge into kat what are u talking about,1
But seeing that ur a mavs fan im not surprised ur biased on the matter,2
"Man oh man, just wait till you start watching all the stars in the regular season",0
"It doesn’t end with Luka, it’s just the beginning if you’re noticing it now.",0
Lisan al Gaib!,0
Gobert is good at fouling without being called for fouling,1
I thought that the foul Luka got jumping into KAT was what the rule change a few years ago was about,2
"if Luka takes a normal 3, KAT likely lands in front of him, at worst in his landing space and it's a debatable foul",2
"but Luka pump-faked, then definitely lunged forward to jump into KAT as he took the shot",0
"the rule change was so offensive players couldn't do abnormal movements to draw fouls, so why change the rule if you're not going to call it? I'm a Dubs fan and have seen Steph called for the offensive foul in this case at least 3-4 times since the rule change.",2
KAT has always been dumb with fouling,2
"He is not a smart player, and will take a foul when he’s upset, or just foul because he thinks he’s supposed to be aggressive, but doesn’t understand that aggressiveness is situational.

Gobert should average 5 fouls a game, and has always gotten away with cheap shoves, elbows, and grabs under the rim.

McDaniels is a great defender who plays physically",1
He’s playing against a team that’s good at drawing fouls.,1
"I know I shouldn’t be surprised by now, but the man actually celebrated before it went in on THAT shot",1
4real,0
People looking for Draymond to be the next Charles Barkley but Ant has a lot more Barkley in him,1
He’s him,0
"Yeah I was about to say, I didnt really feel like Tatum trash talks much when hes up or down.",1
This dude acting like Luka was being a sore loser when bro just wanted to go to bed,0
"That was the most unbothered interview I've ever seen, and he is the last guy I think people should worry about in terms of mental.

Yeah he threw a fit in a game they were winning, but his mentality is just win by any means possible",1
"Luka doesn't give a shit what people think, and he doesn't care about the NBA media getting it's 'narrative'",2
It's why I respect him and Jokic.,0
Yeah tbh...I'm getting the vibe they are gonna get wrecked next game,2
Especially if Lively is back,1
We'll see tho,0
"Quiet, quiet",0
It’s just the media trying to find the next American star,0
"They try their hardest to push the narrative, if it doesn’t workout they’ll hop on to the next guy.

Happened with Zion as well and currently happening with wemby even though he’s not american but good for the international market.",1
Of course it is,0
Jesus,0
Typical box watcher.,2
"Tatum responsible for one too, when we swept the Pacers round 1 in 2019.",1
Ah Celtics fans always classy.,0
"Timberwolfs secrit plays (Micah edition)

- karl and/or rudy rumble down the lane and see how many people make it out alive 
- anthony “turnaround tony” edwards ballet recital with the pivot foot
- Naz Reid
- this one",1
"At least one of his offensive fouls was absolutely not a foul, his final foul was a textbook offensive foul on Luka, and another offensive was a toss up at best but seemed pretty clear that Kleber was sliding under him",1
The whistle he gets is beyond a joke.,0
Saying that with a Clippers flair is dangerous work.,2
Plus,0
This is basketball,0
Good offense beats good defense,1
This isn’t the NFL lol,1
That’s a pretty hot take to say that after everything he’s done this playoffs.,1
I haven’t seen a man contribute to more narrative making than Reggie Miller,1
It’s like TNT gives him a script to hype the kid up.,0
"“I feel like when my time’s up and I foul out, I feel like there’s going to be people who are going to say that I changed the game” - KAT, probably",2
97 free throws in 6 games,1
The biggest rig job outside of the 02 la sac and the black Sox scandal,2
Pelinka just got lucky with the 2019-20 roster imo,1
Even when he looks good it’s an accident.,1
Again do you understand was blatant means? No other GM said publicly what Hinkie said,2
That was his biggest and dumbest error.,0
Thank you for not coaching our team 🙏,0
can this be challenged by the trainer?,0
"lol they still have jokic, the best player in the world",1
I’m sure they are fine.,1
"> it drives me crazy that they're just letting him sit on mcdaniels in the corner every possession.

Maybe Wolves fans can enlighten me, but I also have no clue why KAT doesn't screen for ANT more? He's their best shooter, so...why...aren't they doing a pick and pop? Either ANT goes to the rim or KAT gets a 3?",1
Or Klay Thompson,0
Was this really an on the record quote?,1
Don’t say it out loud tho,1
Adam Silver might be reading the comments.,0
Yes,0
Theres a lot of research these days showing strong social bonds improve peoples mental health and confidence,1
From what I've seen I'm sure Ant has tons of family and friends from his big Georgia Family that help him out,1
Kat probably never had that from what I know,0
Having a real bond on the court with Ant is def helping him,1
At this point how do you even deffend the 3 pointer?,0
it’s true he was,1
Makes sense,0
Sad that such a good shot had to be a foul bait,2
The league is in shambles allowing this stuff,0
"Fun fact, Jordan got swept 2 of his first 3 series of his career, both in the first round",1
"Lost the other 1-3

Checkmate atheists",2
*Stannis voice*: Fewer.,0
I hate Rudy as much as anyone (he's a fucking douche bag) buy he's been +17 in the series,2
"I'm a stats guy, so I have to admit that he's been good overall",1
I hate Kat almost as much (82 game player with an inflated sense of how good he is) so I feel fine putting the blame on him this series.,1
"It’s amazing how far people on this board will go to defend Rudy, it’s the reverse of Draymond and just as sad.",1
"Naz Reid shoots 41% from 3 during the season.
He's a starting big on any team in the league.

If you think his play has been any different than during the season, it just shows you didn't watch him play.

He's actually slightly underperforming his regular season numbers in the playoffs.",2
I don't understand how you're not embarrassed as fuck to be doing that shit in front of millions of people.,2
ofcourse its fucking foster,2
"Hey How can i see these replays?  Would you mind going through and finding a play where ant should have been credited an assist, if you do and the stat is corrected I will pay you.",0
Ain’t no neighborhood in Philly he can’t go,0
"I don’t know what to tell you, literally none of that is correct lol.

KAT jumps leading with his right foot; while he’s in the air his body is leaning back and his center of mass is well behind his leading foot",1
He is absolutely not going to be moving forward any further after he lands because he has his foot/leg out in front of him preventing that,2
I honestly am not sure how you could watch this in slow motion and come to the conclusion that Luka is the only thing that kept KAT from falling forward further,2
"“He has no balance and his momentum is going forward”

No it’s not, just honestly, what are you looking at? From a physics perspective that’s just straight up inaccurate, I don’t know what to tell you lol",1
He has jumped a couple feet forward but his horizontal velocity is pretty minor and most of it dies when he lands,1
"After he lands here he would be more likely to fall straight down or fall backwards than he would be to continue falling forward into Luka, because his center of mass is quite far behind his leading leg",1
"The only way for him to be likely to continue forward would be if his center of mass was over top of or in front of his landing leg, which it’s very much not",1
"That is what happens on a majority of shooting fouls where guys closeout and can’t avoid making contact; their body is angled on a slant leading towards the shooter like a forward slash / KAT’s body is more like this \

This is akin to when Steph shoots a jump shot while jumping forward and then lands with his lead leg and falls down or backs away",1
He is never at any point going to continue moving forward [because of his body positioning](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxnKRSLedS3siVNtIaEWzG0I6ei2kR4T_m?si=RbkS9wvq322YWe4g) and the way he lands,0
KAT is doing the same thing here,0
Go out on a court right now and jump like this with your body leaned back and your foot that far out in front and a stiff leg upon landing and tell me if you’re going to have your momentum carrying you forward lol,1
This is absolutely not a situation where a defender makes a strong closeout and their momentum carries them through the shooter’s body; if Luka shot a normal 3 KAT never would’ve touched him.,1
Great word there,1
"He’s been playing defense lol, what are you talking about",1
"You guys are definitely a top 3 team in the NBA.

I actually believe you overall are better than the mavericks but they just are shitty matchup for yall and also you guys went to war against the nuggets lol.",1
That was the best mic'd up I've seen in a while.,1
This is giving “Biggie was fat”,0
"Maybe, maybe not",0
But certainly trading away Butler makes it much harder to win,1
We have no one on the roster that can duplicate Butlers impact on the game if he is gone.,2
Do you know how small this sample size is,2
reffing is abysmal,0
Agreed,0
Playing for fouls is lame af,2
Thats cynical,2
SGA says hello 👋,0
>Minnesota pushing this to seven does not seem outlandish,0
"Right?

Look, I won't rule it out entirely...

But people realize that pushing a game 7 after being down 3-0 has only happened 4 times, right?

Statistically speaking, *it is outlandish.* A game 7 in this scenario is already a huge accomplishment to ask for.",2
the foul,2
"Again, the 76ers aren't the only team to have a bad few years.",2
I saw it tonight,0
More than usual,1
The refs cracked down on it last year but here we go again,2
Felt sorry for KAT on one of those.,2
It’s crazy this take has so many upvotes,1
Have you watched any games or are you just pulling random narratives,2
"I know he was baiting this game but he got absolutely killed in the last three games when he drove to the basket.


I hate that whenever Luka gets a favorable call the narrative shifts to ""he's always been like this and all the previous calls were baits"".",2
"I can't even be mad about gargling Jokic, dude is the best in the game and he's fair and humble",1
"He pleads for calls sometimes but so does everyone else, and Jokic isn't overly dramatic about it",1
"Luka feels like a whole ass theater kid on the court sometimes I swear to god, been trying to get some friends into basketball and they keep asking me ""do they always call games like this"" and ""why does flopping and crying to the refs work so much"" lol",1
"Luka's too good of a player to be stooping to that level, hope he cleans that garbage up but it's gotta start with the refs making the right calls.",1
Down by 1,2
Ant gets fouled on a 3 point shot,0
Misses all the free throws,1
If you don’t like that you don’t like Minnesota sports,0
You haven't seen a great KAT game yet,1
"You forget he put up 62 in a game this year?

Today was an OK KAT game.",2
"Yeah, I remember being salty the year after he forced his way out and tweeting as he was flaming out of the 3 pt contest that the problem for him there is that every shot is a last-minute shot.",2
Ethically he is top 5 all-time.,1
His dad taught him that,0
That was the only thing I liked about Jokic being eliminated,1
How do people just find new ways of being corny,1
Here comes Space Jam 3,0
"This just in, average fans have no fucking idea how any basic play in the NBA works, or what even goes into the small details of defense.

Of course he has value, but he isn't blocking every shot ever made against him, so he sucks",2
"The TNT staff absolutely cooked him for saying how cold it was, showed a bunch of videos of decent weather while Ernie and crew clowned him haha, was pretty funny",1
Making a shot?,0
"Case against him:
•Cooked one time on a sprained MCL by prime Curry

•Luka hit a tough shot on him once after he stayed with him fairly well

•Can't cover for 4 lousy perimeter guys in the paint while also guarding his man in the corner

•More of a team defender than a one-on-one guy (aka can't guard MVP-caliber scoring bigs with handles and jumpshots)

•Clumsy on offense

•Cried one time

The man is really fucking good and people need to look past the memes for 5 seconds",2
"Bro what didn't he get off horford, simmons, and just opened up a ton of cap room to make another run at contention? It's not his fault embiid is allergic to the playoffs",0
If you simmed the first 3 games 10 times do you think KAT would shoot more or less than 27% from the field on average lol,1
"Not against Luka, Luka outsmarts him",0
Ask wade how is last extension worked out after he brought championships to Miami,0

"when he's not, they are terrible.",2
Annnd he's been T'ed up for doing so? Meanwhile Luka gets away with outright flagrant shit that can injure people and STILL GETS IT CALLED FOR HIM.,2
"Anthony Edwards was a one-man show tonight, almost dropping a triple-double with 29 points, 10 rebounds, and 9 assists, leading the Timberwolves to a thrilling 105-100 victory over the Mavericks to keep their playoff hopes alive! 🏀🔥",1
Minny shot 4 more free throws,1
Am I going crazy ? In a rigged game like 02 or 06,2
They give the team they are rigging for the free throw advantage,1
"Oh don’t worry I have $500, I didn’t waste it on a low IQ bet lmfao",2
Tell me how him and Kyrie can beat Boston with Porzingis lmao,1
C's in 5.,0
It was a correct call even Tim Hardaway jr,0
Would probably get it,0
Series is 3-1 for us if he even remotely bothered to play basketball in the Home games,2
Idk how he managed to shoot like 2 for 100 from 3,0
That is impressively bad lol.,1
No Lively,1
That made all the difference.,0
This wasn’t even a good shot lol just one that went in,1
"Bad distance, bad form, in traffic with defenders on top of him",2
He wasn’t even trying to make a good shot he was trying to get the call.,1
"He didn’t jump into him you and other Redditors don’t know what you are talking about(as usual)

The defender leaves his feet and bangs into him it’s a foul 99% of the time.

Go watch it again KAT didn’t go straight up either, it was a correct call that SGA, Tatum, Harden, or any other player would get",2
I like the comps you listed earlier but Harden is just so much of a better passer that i can’t get behind the comparison,1
Shai can barely throw a lob,2
I would love to agree but our summers make us tan as fuck,2
Source: I live in Minnesota,1
We get ALL the seasons,0
Hot summers,1
Cold winters,2
Rainy springs,0
wtf falls.,2
Kobe or Shaq depending on if its the WCF or Finals.,0
With 2 free throws from our best shooter to win the game,1
1 to tie,0
We miss both.,0
Where foul?,0
In all honesty it was a move similar to what the Texans did and Stroud and Young were not exactly far apart at draft season,1
Hindsight is a thing here.,0
"You just tried to dismiss all talk on the matter by saying none of our talk matters, for forgiving me for not taking that at face value.

And you're kidding yourself if you think any GM is being entirely honest about any trade market evaluation.

>3 mid picks and trash filler is less than the FO could get elsewhere, most likely.

Agree to disagree",1
27 year old 1-time all-star who that team will have to turn around and pay a giant contract to within a year.,1
Thunder fans overrate the hell out of Jalen Williams,0
He will be a Kyrie Middleton type player,0
Not a MVP candidate.,0
When your rigging a game for the mavs you def give the wolves 4 more free throws,1
"The two aren't mutually exclusive, nephew

>A spheroid, also known as an ellipsoid of revolution or rotational ellipsoid",0
"Are we going to act like Luka wasn't 7-21?

He was -13 on the night",0
"He didn't play all that great lmao.

I feel like I watched a completely different game, if these high volume ball dominant players aren't dropping 35 with solid defense then they're not as great an asset as they seem out there.

Luka is fun to watch but I feel like people are missing that",1
There's a lot more to winning basketball games than flashy scoring.,1
Sixers fans tried not showing up and still lost 2 of 3 at home,0
Ehh..,0
"pause.

He routinely will do some dumb shit somewhere in the middle of a good run to just crush our momentum",2
"That definitely includes errant passes that fly out of bounds, or into the other teams hands cleanly.",1
I will punch a wall if this happens,0
I called a sweep but got downvoted into oblivion lol.,1
You seem unbiased when it comes to Luka so I'll take your word for it.,0
A tall shooter is basically unguardable,0
KD and Dirk are both an example of that,0
KAT aint KD tho,0
The wolves shot more ft then the mavs,1
4 more.,1
