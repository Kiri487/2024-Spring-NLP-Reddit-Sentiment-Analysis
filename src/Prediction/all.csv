I think I it is ok for you to be upset that it was something that was hidden from you,1
However what’s not okay & super weird to me is that you expect her to have 0 sexual experiences while you get to have “plenty of experiences of a man.” What about all of the girls you’ve had those experiences with?

"But I see some mildly convective clouds in the distance, followed by two different sets of non-convective clouds",0
Those convective clouds may be stacked up along a weak outflow boundary with decaying thunderstorms behind them,2
My best guess is there are two different processes in place that are creating these clouds,1
"1) a weak low pressure wave moving through the atmosphere, where there are moist layers of air aloft, which is creating or dissipating those non-convective clouds on the left side of the pic",2
"2) thunderstorms created a cold pool of air and an outflow boundary, with those convective clouds forming along the leading edge of that boundary..",2
"though with how broken those clouds are, I'd say the boundary is weak and losing momentum, the bigger storms that generated them may have already fallen apart or are too distant now.",2
