"> The demons can't even kill a few humans, who still get hurt and can't heal themselves

Pretty sure half of the cast were dead by the end of the series.

> but they're ""speed blitzing"" and shredding Sukuna and Maho into pieces? 

Yes, why? It depends whether you're getting anime or manga feats, but taking anime feats, Mahoraga isn't even faster than a shockwave considering that [his entire jump during 2:58 is slower than a shockwave.](https://youtu.be/_jZ6WDKgQvY?si=dzhiX978S9GrKW_M)

Mahoraga also took time regenerating his foot when Akaza could regenerate his entire torso instantly after getting hit by a breathing form.

> Sukuna was pretty casually dodging Kashimo's lightning attacks (which are real lightning in MBA mode)

Any projectile at a sufficient distance can be easily dodged as long as you know the trajectory.

Sukuna also [wasn't able to dodge this in 3:15, btw](https://youtu.be/_jZ6WDKgQvY?si=z5w9-swu9uFV4tzB)

> Mahoraga's whole thing is adapting to anything and everything",1
"If it's not killed in 1 clean hit, it will adapt to the attack",1
"None of the demons have the attack power to kill Maho in 1 hit.

Not really",2
"You just need to overwhelm Mahoraga with attacks before the wheel behind him rotates.

Demons can also just eat Mahoraga, similar to how Muzan and the Upper Moons absorbed those who have challenged them into a blood battle.",2

Because Giyuu doesn't consider himself the Water Hashira,0
"So when he sent Tanjirou to Urokodaki's place, it was with the assumption that Tanjirou would train with Water breathing, git gud, and become the Water Hashira (I guess there's not many water users at the moment).

Tanjirou trained with Water breathing, got gud, and then promptly started using a different style of breathing and also occasionally blending the two.

This is fine in general, however because he's not using *only* Water, he can't become the Water Hashira, which is a vacant position as far as Giyuu is concerned.

So he's essentially mad at Tanjirou for cheating on Water breathing and not being eligible to be the Water Hashira.

If I recall correctly, it was said somewhere that there's Hashira of all different kinds, but there's usually *always* a Water Hashira, a Flame Hashira, a Stone Hashira, a Thunder Hashira and a Wind Hashira, as they're the primary elements.

So having no Water Hashira (and an imposter in the position) is a huge oversight to Giyuu, and it needs to be fixed ASAP.",1

Mappa can do the same, and most other top tier studios as well if they were allowed to focus on a single series with lots of time to polish it.

This looks really good! I love him 🪭💮,1
"I’d say and Akaza and Gyutaro both of them went through extreme trauma and pain throughout their human lives.

Kokushibo can’t because he was born in a rich family was a strong demon slayer and seemed to have an alright life, becoming a demon due to his jealousy.

Doma’s human life was wild cult leader and parents killed each other when he was a kid and he didn’t even care

Gyokko and Hantengu were already pretty messed up as humans",1

happy cake day!,1
Reading a little bit more you see doma blitz inosuke and take his mask off without realizing it,1
Doma could’ve just cracked inoskues head right there,1
Then a little bit after that doma slices inosuke again presumably keeping it shallow enough so that inosuke didn’t die but if he had put a bit more effort he could’ve just carved right into him,1
Also we know that doma is stronger than akaza because she’s upper moon 2,0
You could say that Akaza would’ve gotten stronger had he beaten giyu and tanjiro but he didn’t so oh welp,0
We could go on and on back and forth but just by reading your comments I can tell neither of us is gonna change our minds on this but frankly it doesn’t really matter,1
Whether you believe Akaza is stronger than doma doesn’t really change anything for me i hope you do keep on enjoying the manga,1

Completely valid I love him too lol also Gyutaro👀,1
He’s weak,2
People don’t understand that there’s a clear difference between the power levels of “that” tanjiro and the demons and the current story,1
There’s literally been no feats that suggests this first design Tanjiro is even near the entertainment arc Tanjiro,1
"Before anyone brings up first design Tanjiro soloing Douma, it doesn’t mean anything- it’s clear Douma in that other story is just weak and so is Muzan apparently",2
Has to be Akaza,0
Bro did everything right to get back his life and yet fate still dealt him a cruel blow especially to his beloved Koyuki,2
The hatred towards people and human nature must be immense,0
"Thats Sad to the first degree.

Gyutaro/Ume had a similar plight no doubt where life gave them bad hands and they met unjust ends",2
"But they were in a vicey environment where death and violence seemed more likely and the siblings caused harm to others as well.

Muzan himself was an T virus unexpected medical outcome.
Kokushibo is just a salty egocentric jerk who couldnt stand being second best.

Man I think the most underrated one is hatengu while he has the pettiest backstory,1
He basically demonstrates what demons could do if they were made and if they could work together,0
For example if you combined Akaza's fast paced martial art with the teleportation of Nakime in the infinity Castle you basically have a double threat just there but you combine that with the area of affect skill of Doma and you have a surefire way to take out the demon slayers,1
This guy basically demonstrates how dangerous demons can become inflation focused on their individual strengths and selves and work together as a team to accomplish a goal.,2
I like daki and gyutaro as a duo,0
Thats just cool af to me,1
stunning! ✨,1
"Can’t say it was plot armour since both did lose, at first, fair and square, but alright",1
"Exactly, he wouldn’t do that for a Hashira he doesn’t care about, so Gyomei wouldn’t have to deal with an Akaza reviving himself like I said and would win",1

What’s exactly your point? That Akaza is stronger than Douma? Akaza is 3 and Douma is 2 for a reason…,1

"Try again.



Secondly UM6 destroyed a large part of the entertainment district which by def is a city",1
This easily puts him and MCB+ to small town FAR higher than Toji.,1
I think it implies Muichiro either already made a tanjiro paper airplane (🥹🫶) or possibly has tanjiro coded paper on file for that purpose and Tanjiro used it lol,1
"I suppose Tanjiro could have his own personalized paper, but that makes less sense and is less sweet lol",1
Backstory: >!She was a struggling performer with a shitty selfish husband,2
"He stole her new dress for her performance, and she lost it and killed him",2
"She performed right after that, and it was her best performance",1
"So she started killing men right before her shows, until one of her targets was Muzan",1
"Muzan saw something in her, and the rest is history.!<",0
There literally is a *maybe* because they both lost because of plot armor,0
And the whole reason Akaza offed himself was because he saw tanjiro’s growth and they had history,1
He wouldn’t do that for some Hashira he’s never heard of,0
It was plot armor that killed him,2
🥵🥵,0
2,0
So? Gyomei isn’t Tanjiro and isn’t going to say the same lines as Tanjiro and Akaza DID lose,0
"He admitted to it and Tanjiro did surpass him in that stage, but even then the 13th form is more than enough to handle Akaza, but that’s for another post if someone talks about that.

There is no maybe, Gyomei wouldn’t be in that position",1
"When Akaza and Kokushibou had their blood battle, which is shown in the fan book, Kokushibou was shown to only use his sword, while Gyomei was relative to that (without the mark) and then heavily pressed him after using his mark like the mf he is",2
"ON TOP OF THAT, Gyomei has the red blade, STW and has the ability to change his blood flow to confuse his opponents, which would work against Akaza- if you want to deny it doesn’t, fair enough, and if you want to give Akaza the cheat death method then Gyomei is easily going to keep Akaza until sunrise",1
Nakime,0
But what about Muzan? What grade would he be?,0

"I'm sure there's an argument to be made for Gyutaro and Daki, but my immediate thought was Akaza without a doubt",1

It's never explained,0
One theory is that it's because of the family's usage of Sun Breathing,0
Another is that Kie used Blue Spider Lilies in her food and medicine,0
"They grew near the Kamado residence, and Kie and Tanjiro knew where they were, but it's never stated that Kie used them for anything",1
"So in short, it's unknown why Tanjiro and Nezuko were so special.",1
I would give her a hug instead⚡,0
Yoriichi is the only right answer to this,1
">!From slicing 1,500 out of 1,800 pieces of Muzan to dying while standing unscathed fighting Kokushibo",0
"How cool is that.!<

Tengen is flashy but not that Yoriichi cool.",1
"ill be real here, i can kinda agree",2
Gyokko was CLOWNED ON,0
the disrespect tokito gave him was baffling,0
Only on [c.ai](http://c.ai) ⚡,0
I don't believe Sun Breathing has anything to do with it,0
"Nezuko never used Sun Breathing, and while you could argue it’s because her ancestors did, I personally don't think that’s the case",0
"On the other hand, the blue spider lilies could definitely be the reason",2
"It's stated that demons are vulnerable to sunlight due to the disease Muzan had as a human, and the blue spider lily was used to create the ""medicine"" that turned Muzan into a demon",2
"Since Nezuko and Tanjiro don't have that disease and were in close proximity to the blue spider lily, it's plausible that it could have affected them somehow, causing their immunity.",1
I'm really glad we didn't get it where each of the Upper Moons have their own set of Lower Moons,1
"It would have made the series wayyyy too long.

But also I'm so intrigued what would have happened if they did.",1

Former 6 for sure,1
You mean Upper 5? I feel like his writing was purposefully pissed on for the sake of showing off the mark,2
They kinda overpowered Muichiro and made Gyokko look weak in retrospect,2
"He was cocky, I will admit, but he did have a plethora of unexplored abilities and strength that were screwed over.",0
Very strong if Douma was still UM2⚡,1
Have you tried using an online translator?⚡,0
eh gyokko WAS soloed as an upper moon 4,0
I can see the fraud allegations,0
