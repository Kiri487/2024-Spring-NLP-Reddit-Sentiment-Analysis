My daughter is an animal handler,0
One of her clients has several alpacas,0
The owner is a “gentleman farmer” works in the city during the day so he hired my daughter to go over during the day to take care of the alpacas’ needs,0
Well one day on arrival she realized she was one alpaca short,0
A quick neighborhood search found the next door neighbor a little old lady screaming for help with the truant alpaca keeping her cornered on her patio,1
Once the lady and the alpaca were properly introduced they have become good friends.,1

Like how I am allergic to seafood, so if I’m cooking a pizza, you can’t put fish in with it",1
Because the heat makes it spread,0
"Same with cat poo, no?",0
The lineup in the front is lookin extra saucy,0
Dunno why they were so sloppy in the back.,2

That’s enough internet for today.,0
"Being as emotional as you are over this, something so incredibly minor, where I didn't even denigrate you in anyway until you had a text tantrum, is definitely not something to be proud of.
