If youve known people who have been in accidents where the bags deployed id be surprised if they didnt have bruising on the face afterwards,1
Youre right that its worse for people who sit closer to the wheel though of course,1
"I belive the heading ""Airport executive target and assassinated by ATF Agents who does not know the law"" is more correct as that is actually what happens,  the way this headline is writte seems like the man did wrong in shooting at the unidenifed masked and armed intruders that was there for a unlawful reasons based on politics and not facts.

Give how the warrant was executed,  what the Polic and ATF actually did,  makes my headline more correct,  as there was never wrong of this man to shoot at the agents,  it was however murder for them to shoot him,  even if he shot at them they had no business being there.",1

"""Two days after an Israeli airstrike on another camp stirred global condemnation, Gaza emergency services said four tank shells on Tuesday hit a cluster of tents in Al-Mawasi, a coastal strip Israel designated as an expanded humanitarian zone where it advised civilians in Rafah to go for safety.

At least 12 of the dead on Tuesday were women, according to medical officials in the Hamas militant-run Palestinian enclave.

But Israel's military later said in a statement: ""Contrary to the reports from the last few hours, the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) did not strike in the Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi.""

This reads to me as if it is Hamas statement vs",2
"Israeli statement? Or are ""Gaza emergency services"" not affiliated with Hamas?",0

"Removing statues isnt erasing history, however a lot of good can come from leaving monuments up while contextualizing them so people have a chance to better understand what has occurred",1
"In this case, contextualizing them by informing people that they were created decades after the civil war as a counter to the progress made by people during the reconstruction era is particularly helpful",1
Simply tearing things down doesnt open any opportunity for people to learn how these and similar monuments are total bullshit intended to spread lies,2
"Getting rid of them outright opens up the opportunity for people to assume the myth of continual progress, the misguided framing by which US history is often taught",0
"As in “things were bad for black people during the civil war, but since then have always gotten incrementally better over time”",2
"The reality is that things were bad, then a lot of gains were made during reconstruction, which led to racist reactionists doing everything they could to upend that progress (including building these statues)",2
If we dont draw attention the part of history where people undermined made progress then people can quickly repeat the same mistakes,1
Unsurprisingly we see the same theme with women’s rights right now especially regarding bodily autonomy,1
"If people uncritically adopt the myth of progress that says women must be doing better now than they have in the past then they are accepting a narrative that a) ignores the undoing of women’s rights, and b) implies we dont need to take urgent action to fix things, because in the future we will have made progress",1
"I primarily studied the relationship between monuments and memory in college, and I personally believe that the only statues/monuments we should urgently tear down are those which contain racist caricaturist depictions of people",1
"The faithful slave monument is actually one example of that, and I would be happy to see it go",1
"But its sister monuments that celebrate confederates or the confederacy at large could stay up, be contextualized at the site, and then ideally work against the message they were originally intended to broadcast",1
Generally speaking most all scholars Ive ever read the work of argue that tearing down monuments is not the best solution for actually working against those shitty monuments,1
I would tend to agree,0
"Why get rid of a confederate monument if you can use it to teach people how the confederacy is a racist and stupid legacy whose water is carried by the ignorant? Some might say everyone already knows that, but a lot of people in the South dont believe it because of “heritage”",2
Getting rid of all the confederate statues is just ammo for people arguing their heritage is being erased,0
Leaving them up but making sure anyone who sees them has a chance to learn reality / the truth would do considerably more to undermine that heritage bullshit,1
"How many people who truly believe in upholding confederate heritage know that the confederacy existed for less time than most people spend in highschool? What would things look like if that was more widely pointed out every time someone engaged with a confederate monument? How many people would carry water for the most self-celebrated losers of all time if they knew fully and accurately what huge losers they were? 

The common academic definition of heritage boils down to “using the past for present purposes”",1
"Getting rid of past heritage works, rather than trying to transform their impact, is an act that relinquishes an opportunity to use the past for a present purpose that could spark positive change",2
"Surely, any public employee should have all benefits forfeited if they turn out to be criminals? Not just on January 6th?


So, I mean, if you used to work in the postal service, and then, in your 60s, you are convicted of, say, smoking in an airplane toilet, you should lose pensions, medicaid, medicare etc.? Why should honest taxpayers fund criminals?
